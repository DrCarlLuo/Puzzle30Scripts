Hey folks!
So this is a re-record of my gdc talk, which technically hasn't aired yet because it will air in july, but i have already recorded it and sent it off to them/
This is sort of the extended director's cut of it or or more of the, you know, friends and colleagues version of it.
I don't think i am allowed to share it publicly but i am sort of going to make a private and more extended version of this talk where i go into more detail on a number of the subjects and also provide a bit more background information because this talk...um 
Let me put it this way. It is blisteringly fast at 60 minutes and really is sort of like one full university courses worth of knowledge like crammed into a one-hour talk right or even more than that.
So, it's tough to get it all into one talk and the the point of this talk is to provide information for video game puzzle designers that is useful and relevant from the realm of traditional puzzle design.
And i sort of live in the intersection of both of these worlds and so it was an interesting opportunity to make this talk.
And in fact i'm working at some point you know, a decade from now i'll write a book on this topic.
But i've been working on a series of lectures on the topic and this is sort of a very condensed version of like 30 to 40 lectures on puzzle design topics, which you know, i will get around to recording whenever i'm not too busy with all my other projects.

But anyway, that's all the preamble. Let's get on with the show.
So this is me and this is me at an event called the world puzzle championship.
This was back in 2019. It was in germany and those folks with me are team Canada from that year.
World puzzle championship is sort of an olympiad style puzzle-solving event.
Every country sends a team of their representatives and there's different events both solo as well as team events.
I was 29th in the world that year and first overall among the canadians.

This is one example of a team event from the sudoku competition.
They have a puzzle round as well as a sudoku round.
There sort of different for historical reasons because sudoku got so popular that it split off into its own event.
In this particular event, you had to solve these interacting sudoku pieces in the form of a trophy, 
which you then had to assemble in the correct manner while also obeying all of the constraints of all of the puzzle
And you know the correct way of doing this was to figure out how the puzzle pieces had to fit together solve them and then assemble them.
If you did that in the wrong order then you ended up with this where you had to assemble it and then figure out the solution to the puzzles.

Here's another example from a previous year.
This was 2014 and it is a team chess puzzle where you're sort of standing around on squares.
And there's sort of different things you have to do with the pieces.
My team came third in this event overall and that was a lot of fun.
I mean traditionally, world puzzle championship also has just sort of a lot of exam-style like paper puzzles where you're sitting down and trying to solve a bunch of puzzles in the time.
It's actually that the main event lasts three days and there's like 20 rounds of puzzle solving.
It's kind of a brutal endurance of the brain but a fantastic event and one of my favorite things in the world is to go to world puzzle championship.

Some additional background on me in addition to that.
I love doing puzzle speed running.
This was a world record time i got in a game called a Monsters Expedition.
And that was achieved through all kinds of sequence breaks and breaking the game and finding ways to solve puzzles that the designers didn't expect.
I also have a world record in a quite obscure category of Tetris, Japanese arcade Tetris.
But yeah, so I like puzzle solving. I did a little bit of poker playing. I played in the world series of poker.
I actually had a background before i did puzzles in math olympiads and cs olympiads.
And I have three math degrees. I went to mit. So i'm a bit of a nerd.

On top of that, I also create puzzles you know this is a puzzle where you have to slice this shape into pentominos.
No two adjacent pentominos can be the same shape.
This is a puzzle. It's just a wooden assembly puzzle that i've made.
I've had a lot of puzzle work published in online collections of puzzles as well as on different puzzle blogs and sites over the internet grandmaster puzzles, etological enigma that sort of thing.
My style I like very visual puzzles and puzzles that have unique themes that have a bit of sparkle or enticement to them visually.
and i like to surprise and delight people with the types of things that come out of these setups.
I've also been featured on cracking the cryptic which i think is sort of the biggest youtube channel for logic puzzles.
This is sort of one of my puzzles that was featured there.

uh yeah, so i'm actually i'm kind of a huge puzzle nerd.
I'm actually on the hosting committee for world puzzle championship which will be in toronto in what was originally going to be 2021 and now maybe actually 2023.
Because we may have lost two years of world puzzle championships due to the pandemic.
We'll see how that goes.

I've had a lot of experience mentoring other puzzle designers and consulting on some video game puzzle design.
And i'm working as I mentioned at the start on the lecture series and then possibly one day a textbook on the topic of puzzle design.
But i also have a day job and my day job is I run a video game studio called Lunarch, which we founded in 2013.
Right now the studio has about 15 full-time developers and we are working on our third game.
To give you a background on Lunarch, our first game was prismata which was a sort of puzzly turn-based strategy game.
That is the type of game that you could think many moves ahead because there's no randomness and no hidden information.
I also developed many puzzles for this game. 
The single-player mode is very puzzly but there's also a puzzle mode that has different challenges where there's sort of only one solution or a unique order in which you have to do things in the context of a strategy game where you're managing resources and choosing which guys are attacking and defending.
Our second game is jelly is sticky, which is mostly a solo project of david ree who's one of our other developers.
But I made about half the levels in the game.
It is a sokobon style block pushing puzzle game which is coming out sometime this summer.
I mean maybe by the time gdc rolls around this will be out or close to being out.
we're sort of in the last legs of polishing it up.

Game number three is we're doing a 100 player open world multiplayer puzzle game.
Through like our goal in publishing this game is to have 10,000 handmade puzzles in the game amongst dozens of puzzle types both logic puzzles as well as sort of physical in universe 3d puzzles.
And we're working with dozens of puzzle creators to create the content for this game.
And in the process of making this game I have interviewed, hired and worked with dozens of different puzzle designers.
and puzzle designers come in all flavors like some of these folks i'm working with are doing logic puzzles or they've had stuff published in new york times crossword.
They've done chess compositions which are like chess puzzles.
Some of them have designed content for escape rooms or puzzles for things like MIT mystery hunt.
Many of them have designed physical puzzles.
I'm also working with a number of game designers who worked on indie puzzle games sort of like their own solo indie puzzle projects or have done level design for small indie puzzle games.

I've also interviewed a number of level designers for AAA games that have done sort of more puzzly type, you know, layouts and level design for action adventure like Zelda style games that have puzzles in them that sort of thing.
And through the process of meeting and interacting with all of these people, one of the thing that i've learned is that the approach taken by sort of traditional game designers and level designers versus puzzle designers.
Well let's just say, there's an ocean of difference in how they approach the task of creating the puzzles.
And something else that i learned is that most traditional puzzle designers have actually never worked on video games.
And most video game designers don't really have much of a background in traditional puzzle design.
Even those who are assigned the task of creating puzzles for games they're often just game designer, level designer with sort of a more generalist background.
And suddenly they're immersed in this task of creating a puzzle and they don't necessarily know what to do or even what resources to turn to learn what to do, because there aren't that many of out there.
But puzzle design is actually a very rich topic with a history of hundreds of years.
Humans have been creating puzzles for probably as long as we had language.
But you know there's records of puzzles dating back thousands of years.
And even some of the more famous puzzles that we know today like the the Chinese rings puzzle or the Baguenaudier puzzle that dates back hundreds of years.
So do magic squares.

The problem is that puzzle design knowledge is very siloed.
And there's sort of these different sub areas, you know the crossword people the escape room people.
And they all have their own vocabulary, their own puzzle construction techniques and their own best practices and aesthetic inclinations that they don't really share widely. 
This knowledge isn't available in one source you know.
For example, traditional puzzle designers for a lot of types of logic puzzles, they may hate puzzles with multiple solutions, whereas game developers working on traditional adventure games, like text adventures and point-and-click adventures, they often loved putting multiple solutions in their puzzles.
And so the the sort of aesthetics or the choices vary between these communities.
It's not just because they have their own personalities. 
It's because those choices fit the medium that they are working in.
So often you'll get uh two puzzle designers from different areas working on something and they'll have completely different approaches or instincts, as to whether like we should make this puzzle unique or we should not have a unique solution.
And there are pros and cons to both and reasons why those aesthetic inclinations exist in those sub areas. Right?

So anyways the goal of this talk.
It's themed around 30 rapid-fire lessons, but it's really to introduce traditional puzzle design theory and sort of the language of traditional puzzle design as well as to expose a few of the sort of secret design techniques that puzzle designers use and show applications to video game puzzles.
So in other words we're going to bust open the silos and try to reveal a little bit of that knowledge inside there.
Before we do that, I do want to give credit where credit is due to game and level designers and what they do really well.
Traditional game designers are great at inventing rule sets and sort of iterating on levels via play testing.
They're great at sequencing things and sort of creating a build up to an exciting moment.
They're great at watching people playtest the game and adjust the difficulty in order to sort
of remove stuck points and allow lots of players to get through a challenge.
They're good at creating fun through, you know, what game design people call flow that sort of experience of being in the zone where the level of challenge is just right, so that you feel like you're accomplishing something, but you're not bogged down by getting stuck.
And I think traditional game designers are good at doing this.
There are problems with this approach, right?
You might stand off all of the interesting difficulty of your game if you have a linear puzzle sequence that you don't want anybody to get stuck on, right?
There's all kinds of ways in which this approach will fall short.
And the thing that I think traditional puzzle designers do best is almost completely orthogonal to that, which is they identify powerful eureka moments and they create impactful setups for those eureka moments.
And this to me is sort of the unique skill of a puzzle designer is being good at just this one thing.
And puzzle design is also a skill that's very transferable, like people who are good at designing logic puzzles are also often very good at designing crosswords and escape rooms and physical puzzles and chess puzzles and that sort of thing
Like this is a transferable skill and it can also be transferred to that of video game puzzles which is something that we learned after hiring a lot of these traditional puzzles and just throwing a game stuff and realizing yeah that the content they make is great.
You know i would encourage any game developer or game director who's trying to create puzzles for a game to consider hiring traditional puzzle designers, even if you know they're not experienced at your game engine or whatever it is you're using.
You know, find other people that they can work with in order to make that happen but hire traditional puzzle designers and let them do their thing and you'll see that they'll be able to create interesting stuff no matter what the sort of constraints or the universe you're in is.

Anyways, so on with the 30 lessons.
Lesson number one is eureka moments are the atoms of puzzles.
And really this lesson is just an excuse to define eureka moment, which to me is the most important definition in all of puzzle design.
A eureka moment requires four things to be true for to truly be a eureka moment.
It's a sudden, pleasureful, fluent, confident feeling of understanding.
It's that thing where you know you learn something and you go "oh i get it".
Aka an "Aha!" moment, an insight, an epiphany.
You know I prefer eureka moment. It sounds more exciting than "aha" moment and you know, the word epiphany is sometimes a little bit religious some people don't like it.
So eureka moment it is uh... the common example is sort of in portal where you learn that momentum is conserved when you're entering a portal.
Aka, speedy thing goes in, speedy think comes out.
When you get that and understand it and then use it to solve a puzzle.
That's a very powerful, very memorable feeling.
And so what is a puzzle I defined a puzzle as anything that conceals a eureka moment.
You know puzzles are basically mechanisms for causing amusement or pleasure via eureka moments.
And they do so by taking that eureka moment, packaging it up and conceal it in what could ostensibly be a challenge but is really just a way to probe you in the direction of discovering that eureka moment for yourself.
And so you know the portal example is one, but even just like determining the weak point of a boss like how can you defeat this enemy. That might be an eureka moment.
Even just navigating around a level.
This is an example from super mario bros 3. It's level 6-5, which is it's one of the hardest levels in the game for young children.
Because the thing you have to do is the level actually loops on itself.
When you finish the level you go through a pipe and you just come back to the start.
And what you actually have to do is get the leaf item which allows you to fly and fly up to this part at the top of the cave carrying a shell with you and throw that shell to sort of defeat these enemies and break the bricks to get out this pipe, which is the secret exit but you actually have to exit through this pipe in order to win the level, right? 
So finding that secret, learning what you have to do uh and and also executing that you know,  flying while holding a shell which is sort of non-trivial if you're not that adept at the controls of the game.
That whole sequence is sort of a eureka moment of discovering what it is that you need to do to win that level.
And a lot of level design where the question is not what you have to do, but how right? 
That can often be a eureka moment.

Lesson number two is puzzles are isomorphic to humor
And I attribute this quote to Marcel Danesi who is a professor of semiotics and linguistic anthropology at university of toronto, but he wrote this book called the puzzle instinct where he talks about how the human brain is sort of wired to solve puzzles.
And eureka moments have an interesting psychology.
They're obviously a source of positive affects. People enjoy this feeling.
They're highly dopaminergic which means they Up-regulate memory formation and they sort of buffer your norepinephrine, which means they reduce your stress and increase your persistence.
Like the time when a person is least likely to want to quit playing your game is right after they've had a huge eureka moment.
So they're sort of impulse to continue pursuing whatever it was they were pursuing is greatly increased after a powerful eureka moment.
And so these psychological factors are all identical to humor, right?
So you can think of a good joke as also being a eureka moment. 
It's sort of a discovery where your brain lights up you've just figured it out.
And so all of the things that the sort of the tricks that game designers use to extend playtime in their games like oh let's put in some exciting music, let's add a joke.
You know all of these sort of little blasts of dopamine that cause players to keep pressing through.
Eureka moments are another ingredient in that tool set.
They can be seen as things that, once players have that discovery, will make them want to continue pressing forward.

Lesson number three is maximize the amount of sparkle 
And sparkle i think of as the amplitude of eureka.
This is a term that's very popular in crossword communities and i think that's where it originated.
But I am now using this term everywhere. Whenever i see a puzzle i talk about how much sparkle it has, which really just means like how good is the eureka moment, how deep or memorable or long-lasting or how dense is the puzzle in eureka moments overall.
And so crosswords the eureka moment the sort of sparkle in them comes from a couple of things.
One is the answers themselves being lively and the other is the clues being clever or interesting.
This is literally just a random crossword the the day i was putting these slides together i went on the new york times and i took the most recent crossword which was a saturday from june the 12th and i just pulled it in here.
And let's find all of sort of the interesting things in this run one crossword.
So first of all the actual word choice you know these aren't just random words from the dictionary. 
Some of them are actually phrases like "said i do" or "he's dead jim"  right from star trek.
"play dirty", "easing out".
You know they're not necessarily uncommon things but they're not just dictionary words like they're kind of cool exciting words, you know. "impress me",  "I'm amazed um"
"Said i do" is in here right next to bride, right? 
There's sort of this this little playfulness going on with the the choice of words in this crossword. 
There's also just kind of interesting nouns or interesting ideas.
Some of these have cultural relevance like robyn fenty is rihanna's real name. 
Boston pops, brave heart. You know like movies or things that people enjoy as part of pop culture they can often just make the crossword more lively.
But also the clues, so here's a word "pressbox" and i'm going to show you in a second what the clue was that had this as the answer.
The clue was "it covers the field" and you might have to think about that for a second, like it covers the field that sort of hints at like the grass or the turf.
But no it's actually the press are covering the field as in they are reporting on the game.
The press box is the place where the reporters are that are covering the game and therefore covering the field.
So it's a pun or it's sort of a double entendre or it's a bit of misdirection where you think covering means one thing and it actually means something else.
So when you finally get this answer and it might not be that you solve it. 
It might be that you get all of the other words that are crossing over it and then realize the answer is "pressbox" and then you go "wait press box?"
And then that light bulb goes off and you realize oh i get it cover means that.
And advanced crossword solvers they know to look for these puns and clues, especially when they're solving a saturday puzzle which is sort of the more difficult clueing of of the week. 
It's the difficulty goes up from monday to saturday so if you're on a saturday puzzle you know the author is kind of messing with you, right?
I'll show you one other example which is this word and this word has been in the new york times crossword hundreds of times but this particular time it was clued as follows:
"They might go for a few bucks."
And that one might take a while, but once you you realize this is the word "does" not the word does. It's does as in female deer which might go for a few bucks as in male deer.
When you read they might go for a few bucks you might just think some cheap item.
But no it's it's completely unrelated to that and so this sort of word play or pun or double entendre or double meaning in this case of the word bucks creates playfulness and liveliness in the crossword which makes it more exciting.
I will give you one more example that's quite a bit different.
This is the word "ace" and again been in the been in the new york times crossword hundreds of times. But it was clued this time as "asexual, informally" which is sort of interesting.
I will click this link and i'll show you there's this site called crossword info and you can go through and this is just the new york times crossword you can see every time the word ace was used and how it was clued.
And let me just zoom in a bit.
You know so that was june 12th that was clued as "asexuality".
But before you know a thing in poker a whiz, a king beater, aka ace beats a king. 
Point of no return like in tennis so there's there's some puns in here. 
But this is the first time ever that ace was clued with anything to do with asexuality in sort of 900 results.
uh and so that's interesting but you might also think like... uh what's going on here...where did my uh okay... fortunately that worked when i gave the actual gdc talk i'm not sure why it's messing up here. Anyways um so
This is interesting for a number of reasons, right?
One is the word ace is sort of slang to refer to asexuality is has existed for decades, but it sort of hasn't entered the vocabulary of sort of common folks until more recently, right? 
So sometimes a word being in a crossword can kind of, it can show that slang has made its way into the popular vernacular and be a sign that okay now this is a word that you're expected to know or you're expected to use, right?
It can also give representation to an underrepresented population.
I think there's no coincidence that this was saved for pride month this particular clue.
And you know some people might think oh that's too political. 
It doesn't pass the sunday morning breakfast test.
I don't want to read about sexuality in my crossword but there's other people for whom this is like really important to them, right?
This could make their day and be a thing that makes this a very memorable crossword for them, right?
So whenever you have the opportunity to do that, you should consider well is this going to be something even if it's only for a small portion of your solvers that will will delight them, right? 
And this is an opportunity to do that.

So lesson number four is sort of the opposite of have lots of sparkle. 
It's avoid the chaff.
And in the case of crosswords the chaff you know is this filler stuff that nobody ever likes in their crosswords.
Like you see these words in the crosswords all the time, if you solve them all. You know it's the boring part.
It's often called crosswordese.
There is no sparkle in seeing this you know.
When you see some river in italy, you know it's that one four-letter word and you just put it in , right? 
You don't even think about it anymore.
Incidentally this particular puzzle was an mit mystery hunt puzzle where they had an image instead of a clue for each one of these words.
And you had to sort of diagramlessly fill the thing.
And when you realized that these were all images of crosswordese style clues, it was that in it of itself was kind of a funny eureka moment.
So this was actually a good mit mystery hunt puzzle but the the joke of it being you know just crossword ease words is kind of a funny in-joke among puzzle folks.
Those aren't the only types of bad crossword clues.
There's some other types.
"Green paint" When somebody says that's a "green paint" clue, they mean it's a meaningless word combination like green paint.
If you see the word "green paint" in a crossword then like why are those two words stuck together like you could stick any two words there and as a compound it's not really more meaningful than the sum of its parts.
You'll also often see what are called "strained entries" meaning things that are barely words like "re-waters". 
Is that really a word? 
"not moody" I mean yeah okay, maybe somebody uses those terms but like are you just putting that in your crossword because you needed to sort of make the words fit.
They're not necessarily interesting clues.
A "Natick" is when you have two un-guessable names crossing each other and this is uh well. There's a long story behind what a natick is and why it's called a natick.
But it's from Rex Parker's crossword blog where one time he he literally finished the entire crossword except for one letter.
And it was the first letter in natick was missing and the horizontal word there was like the name of some actress that he had never heard of.
So he just like didn't know what that one letter was and so this there's this rule and crossword that you you should never have two unguessable names that are crossing one another and sharing a letter.
Here's another one which is "ALDI".
ALDI is a grocery store chain. It's a german style grocery store chain, very popular in the US.
There's thousands of them.
The only thing wrong with this clue is that well it's a popular grocery store chain in the eastern half of the United States and around LA. 
But if you are elsewhere, you may have never heard of aldi and so if somebody clues this in the crossword.
And you know, the new york times crossword is supposed to be a crossword for all of the united states.
So they may not put this word in because it wouldn't be fair to people who don't live in an area where this grocery store exists, right? 
So making sure that the word vocabulary is accessible to everybody is important.

Next, surprise is a key source of sparkle.
And well, the sort of lesson here comes from Sam Lloyd who is one of the most famous puzzle creators ever.
If you've ever seen this sort of square rearranging trick that is due to Sam Lloyd.
Also, if you've ever seen these trick donkeys where you have to place the driver such that he's you know, both drivers are riding both donkeys and there's a clever arrangement of it that changes the way the donkeys look.
That's also a sam lloyd puzzle but I want to give you another one of sam lloyd's puzzle which is a chess puzzle.
This is a white to move and checkmate black in three moves puzzle.
The sort of white to move in mate and three is what's called a stipulation in chess puzzles.
It means sort of here's the constraint under which you have to solve this thing.
And let me pop this out.
So you might try a couple of things like you know, you can capture this rook and put the king in check and in fact you can checkmate black doing that, but you cannot do it in three moves.
It will take longer.
The move that you end up having to do is just moving your king up the board.
And if you're a chess player that might seem like kind of a strange move like you're allowing black to queen here with double check checking you with both the brook and the queen at the same time.
It seems like this would be the last possible move that would enable you to checkmate black.
And in fact if you capture the queen, you cannot checkmate black in three moves.
The thing you have to do is move away from the queen and now you only have one move left the next move white has to deliver checkmate and it seems like black should be able to stop this in so many ways.
Like you can check the king.
But actually white can block the check and deliver checkmate at the same time.
And that's true even if you check the king here.
White can capture the queen and then checkmate black at the same time.
And in this puzzle in this position right here, there are no less than 10 ways that black can put white in check and for every single one of them white has a response or a counter that simultaneously checkmates black, which is amazing.
It's mind-blowing. It's one of the greatest chess puzzles that has ever been created.
And when sam lloyd created this puzzle, he sort of remarked that this was the most implausible move imagined or imaginable.
And why is my uh it's gonna be one of those days um okay well yeah 
And this was actually entered in a tournament of chess puzzles and it won first place.
And sam lloyd sort of remarked that his goal was to compose a puzzle where if you showed this to a thousand grand masters.
The correct move would be different than to what 999 of them would propose.
And in fact, more recently with chess end game databases where there's you know a giant table that contains every single position with eight or fewer pieces and you know whether white wins black wins or nobody wins and how many moves it takes to win.
People have been mining those databases for situations in which you have to do something crazy to win.
Like you know promote two pawns to both a knight and a bishop and nothing else works， right？
Like people have been trying to find these situations in which the most absurd thing happens and why?
The answer is because this sort of surprise this sort of unique discovery is what creates the eureka moment and makes it very very sparkly.
It's like this is totally implausible and it yet it happened.you know.
You're showing something interesting.

The next lesson is sort of interesting truths are the root of surprise, right?
the thing that makes that chess puzzle interesting is that like that move is the winning move, right?
That being a truth that is shared to you through the puzzle is what makes the puzzle have that sparkle.
I will show you one other chess puzzle example.
And that is this one which is a smothered mate theme.
The correct move here i mean it looks like white's in trouble.
He's down the exchange but there's an easy way to win.
And it's to move the queen up here and black cannot recapture it because there's a bishop guarding the queen.
But black can recapture it with a rook, after which white can then move the knight here checkmating the king trapped by its own pieces.
And this theme is called the smothered mate and it actually occurs quite often in real chess games.
And sort of the fact that this smothered mate is possible is itself an interesting truth.
And the sort of value of this puzzle is its ability to convey that truth to the solver by setting it initially as a challenge but then sort of the solver realizing "oh okay" 
There's this cool thing that happens when you win.
You might ask why is the smothered mate interesting and we can come up with a list of reasons.
One it's a it's a very tough position. Like normally you would be losing in this position as white and so the fact that there's a way to win is somehow a turnaround or a surprise.
Black is in fact one move away from winning in this final position.
Like black can take the queen here and capture down on F2 and then mate white in the corner.
Or black can back-rank mate white in two.
Like black has two mates in two here, but yet white was able to win.
It also involves a queen sacrifice which is always exciting always interesting.
There's this sort of dramatic irony of the pieces that are protecting the king somehow being the downfall.
Like if only that pawn wasn't there, the king would just be able to escape this check and it would be nothing and black would be crushing here.
But the fact that black is lost is due to its own pieces which is somehow a dramatic irony.
And finally there's this lone knight delivering checkmate.
Often in chess you're delivering checkmate with two or three powerful pieces, right?
But here it's just a knight.
You'll almost never see a knight giving checkmate on its own.
And somehow these are all things that make it surprising.
And fundamentally they're all unexpected things.
And the fact that these are unexpected is what makes the puzzle exciting or have this sparkle or this value.
There is a sort of neuroscience reason for this.
And it's really that more unexpected things are actually genuinely more dopaminergic.
And i'm sure you've all seen the classical rat in cage operant conditioning experiments, the skinner box from the 1950s.
I want to tell you about one more recent variation from more like one decade ago.
And in this variation you have a rat in a cage and there's two levers.
And one of them gives the rat food 70 of the time and the other gives the rat the food 30 of the time.
And through pressing these levers the rat learns "okay there's a good lever and a bad lever"
It learns to press the good one.
But then behind the scenes the people running the experiment switch the probabilities.
And the rat will at some point realize that his good lever has gone bad and will try the other one.
And once the rat realizes that other lever the bad lever is now good, the rat will have this dopamine spike, right?
And they're measuring this by putting sort of these probes inside certain parts of the brain and actually literally measuring the dopamine concentration.
And they'll see that it's actually spiking.
Not necessarily just when the rat gets food but when the rat learns or discovers that the probability has switched and that the the bad lever is now good.
And so that's not the experiment.
The experiment is what happens if instead of doing 30-70, you do 90-10 and then switch it to 10-90.
Will you still get the same dopamine spike and the answer is you actually get a bigger spike.
And they sort of showed a correlation between the size of the spike and the amount of surprise.
And essentially the bigger the surprise, the bigger the spike.
The more unexpected something is, the larger this dopamine spike is.
And remember that you know dopamine isn't just about reward or feeling good or pleasure.
It's about memory and habituation and incentive and persistence.
You know to sort of seek more of the same and to remember the discovery you just had.
And the human brain and in fact all mammalian brains, they sort of evolved to find novel and unexpected things interesting and to remember them strongly and to seek more knowledge upon discovering that knowledge, right?
The the dopamine reward system evolved a billion years ago in sort of primitive worms and sea creatures to motivate like feeding and mating and that sort of thing.
But in humans and other mammals it's been hijacked to give this additional purpose by evolution and that's to incentivize you to seek and remember novel and surprising things.
Your ancestors out competed their distant cousins because they were more motivated to seek novel and unexpected discoveries and were better at forming strong memories around those experiences which were crucial to their survival.
And so as puzzle designers, what we're really doing is we're exploiting this natural human puzzle instinct to find pleasure in interesting and novel discoveries, whether that's you know making fire for the first time or making a stone tool or speedy thing goes in speedy thing comes out.
And often when sort of novice game designers are making puzzles, they have this approach which revolves around youknow, create a puzzle using some game elements, make it not too hard and then the player will eventually win and feel smart.
Is there something wrong with this approach?
And well it there's nothing wrong per se, but there's often a bit of confusion here which i will sum up in the next lesson,

which is eureka is not fiero um fiero is this

italian word that means the emotion of

overcoming a tough challenge and i've

heard now a lot of game designers are

using this word

uh for sort of that feeling when you're

playing an action game and you finally

vanquished a

really difficult boss you know or you're

a speedrunner and you just got a world

record or you've

you've killed a really hard boss in dark

souls or devil may cry or beaten a

really tough fight in doom

eternal on ultra nightmare mode um you

know the the japanese have this word

yata that they yell when they've

they've done something really difficult

uh

and if you're comparing eureka to fiero

i think of them as two sort of

completely orthogonal ways

of delivering pleasure and here i can

put them even on an axis

right like dark souls is a very fiero

dense game

and there are some brutally difficult

puzzle games that also sometimes the

the pleasure is mostly just the reward

of having solved something really really

hard

but then there are games like portal

where the speedy thing goes in speedy

thing comes out is not necessarily hard

like you don't necessarily feel rewarded

because you did a hard thing or you

overcame a difficult challenge

the pleasure is through the discovery

for the most part

um you know and and so this method where

you create a puzzle and make it

challenging and hope the player feels

good or or feels

satisfied when they've solved it i think

of this as the fiero

approach to puzzle design uh it's it's

an approach motivated by valuing

overcoming the challenge

rather than learning the deep

interesting thing or making that

interesting discovery that has the

eureka moment and has the sparkle

um both of these elements are there in

various places

uh but one thing to understand is that

you don't even have to be the person

that solved the puzzle to get the eureka

moment right you could be sitting in a

classroom and getting a yuri come on you

could have somebody

show you a puzzle and show you how it

works and you still get the full value

of the eureka moment

whereas the fiero is when you yourself

are presented with a challenge and

nobody spoils you on it and you solve it

yourself

um and people who care a lot about

spoilers

they're caring about preserving the

fiero they're caring about preserving

uh the ability for a player to make the

discovery on their own

which heightens the experience by in

addition to giving you the eureka of oh

this is so

interesting giving you the fiero of and

i figured it out

right it's those two things together

that are are combining

uh synergistically i would say um so

is the fiero approach bad well one thing

i would say

is that any challenge can confer fiero

like action games

even just going through something really

grindy and or annoying sometimes just

being done with it can feel good

uh but puzzles have eureka as sort of

their

unique selling point their unique

feature um

so the question is always ask people as

well why are you making puzzles

um because like many game designers use

puzzles for what i call sort of the

wrong

reason or maybe an underwhelming reason

which is just to sort of increase play

time or to give you a break between the

action moments

sometimes literally just to insert an

obstacle so that the reward afterwards

feels better

or so that you feel relief when it's

over and you know if you're just putting

puzzles in your game to pat out the play

time or to act as downtime or whatever

like that's fine it's your game you can

do what you want

uh but eureka moments are sort of the

soul of puzzles the unique superpower of

puzzles so if your puzzles don't have

interesting eureka moments then

as a creator of art or as a creator of

some

creation that you're hoping players will

enjoy you're failing

to live up to the aesthetic potential of

puzzles as a medium

if puzzles are really prominent part of

your game

then i think you sort of owe it to your

game to apply the same level of

aesthetic scrutiny

to the puzzle design in the eureka

moments that you would to you know your

visual art your story your combat your

character movement the things that game

designers traditionally care a lot about

um

but you should care about the eureka

moments of your puzzles as much

and if you're just inserting them there

to sort of fill a gap

then you might not be doing that and i i

feel that a lot of

games that have little puzzle mini games

in there

you know you know the ones that i'm

talking about they're doing this um

i'll give you a a quote from jonathan

blow he says it's not a good idea just

to try to be trying to make the

player feel smart you want to

communicate to them an actual substance

of something

john is the guy who designed braid and

the witness and he's

spoken at length about his approach to

puzzle design in various interviews

um and i think he sort of shares this

notion that the the aesthetic of making

a good puzzle isn't just

about making a challenge that makes the

player feel satisfied it's about

having something deeper as a part of

that puzzle that the player can uncover

and then

you know communicating that truth to

them through the puzzle where whether

it's a truth about discrete math or

or something that may have nothing to do

with the universe of the

story of your game uh it's it's more

just the puzzle is a representation of a

deep and interesting

mathematical idea or logical idea that

you can then learn through trying to

solve that puzzle

i will give one more example these are

two puzzles the left one

is a puzzle by john conway called the

shipper's dilemma and in it you have to

fit all of these blocks into a five by

five by five zone

and they are uh i think you get six two

by four by ones

six two by two by threes and then five

uh one by one by ones to sort of fill

the remaining

voids and this puzzle is a ten out of

ten

fascinating deeply interesting puzzle

that

once you solve it the configuration of

the solution there's essentially only

one solution

up to trivial symmetries and that

solution

has a very unique way of covering the

space inside of this cube

and you can do all kinds of mathematical

analysis to reason about why that must

be the one solution

and if you just try and plonk them in

there randomly you won't solve it you

need to think

deeply about covering up the space

inside that

cube in order to solve it but it's it's

not necessarily that difficult it's just

you have to apply

a bit of a mental strength to get there

um

but this puzzle contains so much

interesting truth like you can learn

about reasons why that solution is the

only solution

that have sort of a deep combinatorial

significance to them like

uh things involving tiling the colors of

the inside of the cube you can sort of

look at

oh what about these exact 27 squares in

the cube how do we cover just

those and you can see sort of sub

problems of covering the whole cube that

reveal insight about what the solution

has to be

meanwhile the thing on the right is you

have this

zed pentomino and you have 25 of them

and you just have to fill the whole cube

with them

and somebody wrote a computer program

and discovered yeah there's four

solutions

and there's not really any solving

method or any insight this is literally

just sort of a time wasting toy where

you're playing around with these blocks

and trying to fit them in and you will

just try random stuff and eventually

you'll get it but you won't have any

knowledge of why that worked or how

you were able to set it up so that it

did that um

you know it's still a fun puzzle that

will amuse people but it doesn't reveal

any truth about the universe there's

nothing

interesting about the solution to this

puzzle it's just

putting blocks in a box um and i think

one of the things that john blow said in

the same interview was that uh

the beauty in puzzles sort of the amount

of beauty is is correlated to how much

truth they reveal

right or how much uh information about

the universe

can be shared with the solver because of

that puzzle and this left puzzle is is

very dense in truth and beauty and this

right one is

to me it's just a time waster like uh

and there are many many puzzles like

this

that there's not actually an interesting

solution method or an interesting trick

it's it's literally just play around

with the thing until it's done

um and so to me if i'm looking at the

aesthetic values of puzzles as

a medium this one on the left the conway

shipper's dilemma is

at the absolute peak and the one on the

right is just

bland um and it's sometimes hard to tell

the difference it's sometimes not easy

to you know there's no place where

puzzles are ranked necessarily according

to how

truthfulness how much truth they have

right like um it's something that you

know real

nerdy puzzle folks know and will give

you recommendations about

um but it's it's i think the sort of

general vernacular about when people

talk about puzzles they like they don't

even have the words to describe this

right the the fact that this puzzle is

better than this one in a way that is

deep and meaningful

is hard for some people to understand or

describe um

but the way i explain it is just how

much truth is there in this puzzle

um and so you know this is this is

basically a meme but if your goal is

creating great puzzles

then focus on communicating those

interesting truths to the solver rather

than just

making the solver feel smart or feel

satisfied that they completed a

challenge

that all said different solvers do seek

vastly different solving experiences

like

the most popular sudoku books are

actually these just like giant book of a

thousand puzzles

um some people refer to this as computer

generated crap

uh but uh honestly there are people

who've done this for hundreds of hours

and they like it

uh it's because they're seeking a

certain solver experiences some solvers

just want that sort of low dose low

difficulty

uh repetition of the eureka moments they

already know they just want to be

reminded of it and they want to flow

through the puzzles

gradually and feel the accomplishment of

uh

just making progress and solving and

completing all the puzzles in the book

rather than having this sort of you know

high-dose uh roller coaster of

interesting eureka moments that might be

more difficult or might present more

challenge um there are other puzzles

that have

these different aesthetics like the

chinese rings puzzle actually requires

341 steps to solve

um it's it's basically 1024 divided by

three

is how many steps it is uh and uh

the process of going through and solving

it is actually a very deep and

meditative one where you you kind of

have to remember where you are

and you have to like it's sort of like

counting in binary

um and it's it's less about the eureka

moment i mean there is a deep eureka

moment when you're discovering that this

is actually what you have to do

but the process of solving it is more a

process a meditative and slow process of

methodically going through the motions

uh and there are puzzle designers that

have taken this to the extreme this is a

puzzle called the 205 minutes cube

by alexander leontev and it's called the

205 minutes cube because if you're

making one step per second that's how

long it takes you

uh and the way it works is it has all

these little uh

blocks inside with pegs and you kind of

have to like push and pull them out and

you end up counting

up to 3 times 2 to the 12 in binary

in the process of solving this puzzle so

it's quite a grind

but some people really like this this is

an expensive puzzle that people will pay

money for because

they want the experience of just like

solving this thing that takes them a few

hours

uh there are also like logic puzzles

that are the size of a newspaper and

these aren't necessarily

puzzles with sort of unique and

interesting structure that all merges to

one final

climactic ending no it's you can start

anywhere on the grid and just slowly go

through it

but some people like this because they

just want that slow meditative

experience of solving a puzzle and they

want the

excitement at the end of having done

this big project right so

people solve puzzles for different

reasons we try not to judge them

but like understand the sort of

aesthetic goal of what you're creating

and who you're creating it for that's a

part of creating any

any creation in any medium right um so

next lesson is eureka is

shareable uh so this right here is chris

ramsey he runs

the most popular puzzle youtube channel

on youtube where

he's often solving these very

interesting uh sort of trick locks and

contraptions and

things you have to get inside things

that have multiple steps they're they're

often called sequential

discovery puzzles and uh you know here's

an example this puzzle he literally has

to use a

phone that's been wrapped up in this

sort of wooden thing to make it look all

ancient

and there's some ar thing going on where

he has to play a melody with a little

mallet in order to

sort of satisfy the the constraint of

the phone which will then

open up the next part of this puzzle

it's it's wondrous to watch this

uh but the sort of lesson that comes

through these sql

sequential discovery puzzles and every

one of these videos by the way has more

than a million views on youtube right

like they're quite popular

the lesson is that eureka can be fully

experienced by an audience like

all of the excitement of learning and

discovering the things that you learn

and discover solving these puzzles

uh can be seen by the audience and these

videos like some people would regard

them as

spoiler videos for everything right

but the sort of aspect of learning the

truth cannot be

spoiled that moment is the same moment

whether or not

you know you discovered it for yourself

or not it's the fiero that you're

spoiling

and these puzzles are often puzzles that

the audience you know they may never buy

and solve for themselves right there's

so many puzzles out there that you'll

never actually do all of them

so the experience of watching somebody

else do them can be a way of getting the

eureka moments without necessarily

enduring the hours of trying to solve

them yourselves and some people prefer

that experience right like if you can

just spend 20 minutes and get all of the

eureka out of a puzzle

rather than spending three hours trying

to solve it yourself and encountering a

lot of roadblocks and getting stuck but

then ultimately overcoming it

i mean those are two completely

different experiences but in terms of

the value they deliver for time they

offer different things

right so some people may just prefer to

watch somebody solve these puzzles and

learn about them

the next lesson uh also relating to

sequential discovery puzzles is to

create

many eureka moments and this is a puzzle

called the lotus box by will streibos

and it has so many tricks packed into

this little puzzle this thing has

magnets it has hidden compartments it

has a spin move

it has a thing that is secretly two

pieces but looks like it's one piece and

you have to like hold one bit to the

side to kind of provide a little bit of

friction so that you can then pull it

apart

um it has all kinds of stuff buried

inside this one little box i counted

eight separate eureka moments in the

solution of this thing

uh and it's wonderful and that's why

people are willing to sort of

like these things are hard to find you

gotta buy them online and order them

um escape rooms are similar uh if you've

never done an escape room i would

highly encourage you to do them uh you

know if you're in a post-pandemic world

and they're open again

uh you know do five of them honestly

like take your whole team to do them if

you're working on a gamedev team in a

puzzle-heavy game

uh they tend to have about 10 to 15

puzzles in one hour

they're very intense they're high dose

experiences not just because of the time

pressure but also just because of the

sheer amount of content

they're often extremely dopaminergic

highly memorable

so they can be kind of addictive there

are people that you know oh i've done

400 escape rooms right

they literally have their tally and you

know their their credo amongst

themselves is never think about the

total amount you've spent on them

um but escape rooms were a two billion

dollar year

industry in the us alone in 2019 and

that was sort of the biggest

they were still growing in fact before

the pandemic hit and

who knows whether they will come back to

that extent afterwards

um but i highly recommend them and i

have had

wonderful fascinating experiences i have

done escape rooms where i've had to

crawl around on my hands and knees and

sniff things

in order to solve a puzzle related to

sniffing and it was a

a puzzle themed after being a cat

escape rooms take you in in wonderful

places and

i think as a game designer you can learn

a lot from what they've done now the

interesting thing about escape rooms is

that many of the people who are working

on these

they didn't start in puzzle design they

may have started in

in like theater set design or maybe they

were designing haunted houses or they

were working on the tech

for you know uh making stuff pop out at

you at a haunted house right

and they've applied that to creating

this escape room

but yeah escape rooms are great i'm

going to pause the recording now i will

start part 2 in just a sec
