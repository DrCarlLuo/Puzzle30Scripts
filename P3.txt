okay welcome back this is part three the

last part

um here we're gonna get into some real

nitty-gritty puzzle construction and

design

stuff um so you know

this is the meat of the talk really um

lesson number 21 is

speak playfully to the solver and uh

to illustrate this i i want to show you

an akari puzzle akari

is a puzzle type where you're given a

grid it's a logic puzzle

and there's some cells that have

different numbers in them

and the goal is to place light bulbs in

the grid in some of the empty cells

and there are three rules one is that

the lights shine horizontally and

vertically and your goal

is to cover the whole grid to illuminate

the whole grid using lights

however there are two constraints one is

two lights are not allowed to illuminate

each other

and the second is the numbers on the

grid tell you the the number of lights

adjacent to that number in the sort of

north south

east west directions so a two for

example

like this one has two lights next to it

here and here

and this one has one light next to it

there and so on that's it

um so i want to show you the solution to

this puzzle

uh and we will observe some remarkable

things

um so this is a site called puzzlink

where you can play a lot of these types

of

logic puzzles um and we'll take you

through the solution at first actually

this is this is a somewhat difficult

puzzle this is not necessarily a

completely beginner level puzzle

at first you may not find any immediate

location to make progress but one thing

to look at is this one in the corner

and so we know that there's either a

light bulb here

or here but we don't know which of those

two it is yet

however one thing we can deduce is that

there cannot be a light bulb here

because if there was a light bulb here

then both this cell and that cell will

be

ruled out from having a light bulb

because two light bulbs cannot

illuminate each other um therefore there

can't be a light bulb here

and so using a dot we can mark this cell

as a cell that doesn't have a light bulb

another way of seeing this is that if

there was a light bulb there

or a light bulb there in both cases this

cell is ruled out from containing a

light bulb

therefore in both cases there's no light

bulb here

we can make similar progress by looking

at this two here

there's sort of three candidate

locations where a light bulb could be

but only two of them will contain light

bulbs however

we can deduce that this cell right here

cannot contain a light bulb

otherwise there would only be one other

space left adjacent to this too because

these two cells would both be

ruled out therefore there cannot be a

light bulb

here and so knowing that these two cells

cannot be light bulbs allows us to make

additional progress if we look at this

two right down here we may

also deduce that this cell can't be a

light bulb because again it would rule

out two

possible locations of the three that

could be light bulbs

therefore there's no light bulb there

similarly there's no light bulb here

because it would rule out those two

cells leaving only one place remaining

for another light bulb adjacent to this

two

so there's no light bulb there and now

we can look at this one and do similar

logic there can't be a light bulb here

because it would rule out both of these

therefore that's not a light bulb

and that chains into the next two and

now we can't have a light bulb here or

here because they would both rule out

too many locations

and using the same type of chaining

logic we could see on this two there

can't be light bulbs here and there

and then this dot implies that for this

one there can't be a light bulb there

and then this too is then implied that

there are no light bulbs here

or here and now on this one we can learn

that there's no light bulb here

and on this one we can learn that

there's no light bulb here because again

it would rule out all the possible

locations where a light bulb could be

and then these two dots together imply

that we can't have a light bulb

here because it would rule out the only

remaining locations next to this one

and the chaining keeps going this two

rules out that this two rules out these

two that one is now ruled out from here

this dot that we did earlier also rules

out this side

and now finally after all that setup

after all that work we finally have this

one over here

where both sides of it have been ruled

out and we can finally place our first

light bulb in the puzzle and after that

placing

placing that light bulb in the puzzle we

can place the light bulb next to this

one

we could place the two light bulbs next

to this two

which then allow us to place the two

light bulbs next to this two which allow

us to place the light bulb next to this

one

and then these two and then this one and

then these two

and these two and this one and these two

and it just keeps going until we place

the last two next to these

and to finish the puzzle there is one

square remaining that hasn't been

illuminated and of course we have to put

the final light bulb there

and that is the solution to this akari

puzzle

and there are so many things about this

puzzle that are remarkable

um you know there's this whole sense of

playfulness

as you're going through the puzzle and

taking these steps one leading to the

next leading to the next

there's this repeated pattern or motif

where

you're using the same lemma or the same

uh pattern

or technique over and over again to

create this chain

repetition of logic um and then there's

a variant or a twist

on that lemma where you know you're

using it once and then a second time on

the same thing

um and there's the whole setup and

payoff like you do one lap around the

grid

to rule out one set of spaces and then

you do a second lap which rules out a

second set of spaces

and then results in the final placement

of the the light bulbs

the whole surprise ending where there's

only one space left is sort of

um a cherry on top but you know you look

at a puzzle like this and there can be

no doubt that it was created by a human

this puzzle is

is just like it's it's beautiful

um there's some steps of how it's

created that feel a little bit similar

to sort of the nintendo

4 step level design where you have

something new and then you sort of

introduce it and then create a twist on

it and then

um you know put it together to into a

finale

uh and and then you know you might throw

away this idea for your next puzzle um

but there's something special going on

here and it makes the experience of

solving this puzzle more than just one

of

um you know finding the answer or

something it's it's it's like

communicating with the author of this

puzzle

and i'll share with you a quote from

nobuhiko kanamoto who

was the editor of nicole and this is way

back this is two decades ago before

sudoku took over in the west this is

when

sudoku that was computer generated was

just starting to come out

and um kanemoto-san remarks that

computer-generated sudoku puzzles are

sort of lacking that vital

ingredient that makes puzzles enjoyable

this sense of communication

and you know what ended up happening was

these sort of

massive uh numbers of computer-generated

sudoku puzzles flooded the newspapers in

the west and the puzzle books in the

west and

and as a result um you know subscribers

of nicole and other japanese puzzle

magazines

they had this sort of taste for

handcrafted puzzles

uh but folks in the west never developed

that taste they were just bombarded with

computer-generated puzzles which

uh is is sort of a tragedy in some ways

because the the

subtlety and excitement of really good

sudoku puzzles or other

paper-based logic puzzles um has been

lost and a lot of people think of sudoku

as as sort of

a tired boring not that interesting not

that novel puzzle

um but there are good sudokus this is a

book uh by thomas snyder

called the art of sudoku and uh

it's just one of many examples but the

puzzles in this book

they're not only artfully designed and

laid out but they also have this sort of

flow between the puzzle maker and solver

where you're taking on a journey from

starting the puzzle to the end where

more and more things are

revealed to you and if you've never done

a good sudoku puzzle

i would highly recommend you actually

try them um

better yet go on cracking the cryptics

youtube channel and look at some of the

more interesting sudokus that they've

done and give

give them a try yourself um but

you know the question is how do you

design puzzles like that and there is a

trick there is a technique that allows

us to do that

and it's um well the technique is called

designing from the front

aka forward design and i will show you a

demo of this

um and we're going to open up

the creator for these types of puzzles

um

and i'm literally yoloing it like when i

did the recording of the gdc

talk i sort of had a plan of what i'm

going to do but here i'm literally just

going to make it up as i go

and so we're creating an akari puzzle

let's let's make a low difficulty one

and insert lots of easy steps

something we might do is let's let's put

in a zero a zero is sort of an obvious

place to get started it's a so-called

hook

it's a thing that the player will

immediately take their pencil and put in

something

um and let me just zoom out a tick the

the method that we're using here is

we're gonna place clues

and solve the puzzle at the same time

and we're going to place clues in the

order that the player would sort of

notice them as they were solving the

puzzle

so we flip an answer mode and then in

answer mode we'll mark these two cells

as cells that uh the solver will know

are not light bulbs and then we'll go

back into edit mode and let's just add

some more stuff

um you know let's let's try putting a

two here

right and then we'll go into answer mode

and the solver will realize okay well

after the zero goes there then we have

to put two

light bulbs there let's go back into

edit mode let's try putting some walls

here and here

this will create a situation where that

cell needs to be lit by a light bulb

but the only possible location of a

light bulb to light it up will be here

because anywhere else um you know we

can't put a light bulb there so then we

go back to answer mode and we stick a

light bulb there

uh let's see what else let's let's try

putting a wall here and maybe these two

light bulbs

we want them to infer together the next

step and let's try

uh let's try putting a two here

uh and then our solver upon sort of

seeing the top and bottom of this two

have been ruled out can put two more

light bulbs

there and there uh okay pretty good now

now we're gonna have to make sure like

we can't put a block there otherwise it

will have invalidated

that part of the solution so we kind of

have to keep in mind

uh what are the bits that are required

to sort of make the puzzle that we've

done so far

work um but you know if we feel that uh

the lights are shining too far and we

need to add more obstacles we could add

some obstacles on this side let's say

um you know i'm not sure what we're

going to do there maybe

uh well let's see we could try

uh we could try putting a 1 here and

that will allow us to

rule out these two cells now that we've

put one there

can that do something interesting uh

well we could maybe put a block there

and then we know a light bulb has to go

in the corner

uh sure let's do that because that you

know these two cells both have to be lit

up but we can't put one there

maybe this could also reveal something

to us uh let's try

let's try something a little more

sophisticated here let's let's copy the

trick

from that previous akari puzzle whereby

because

one side of this two has been blocked we

know that this can't be a light bulb

and this can't be a light bulb because

either of these would rule out

too many spots and the two would only

have one location left so let's try that

then we learned that these are not light

bulbs

let's try well we could try putting a

two there

and then we'll place those two there

which then feed back into the two that

we were just in

and give us two light bulbs there and

there lovely

uh what now and you can see how this

just flows like i'm

literally just making this up as i go i

do not have a plan

um maybe i could have a plan and i could

try to make a puzzle that has a certain

pattern or goes around the grid in a

certain way like maybe i want the flow

to kind of go in a circle and come into

the middle that can be a nice motif

let's try doing that so let's make it so

this one kind of goes

up and gives us some logic in the upward

direction like maybe this one and this

one can combine and we can have

uh let's try and think let's put a

number there maybe

maybe a one and maybe all three of these

combine to

force a light bulb uh in the upward

direction

there whoops answer mode boom

um and now this will sort of push logic

horizontally

let's see we could we could put one here

maybe we could put a

a one here and then we have that one

maybe these two then are going to

combine together i mean we can

we can reuse tricks in a new setting or

we could have new tricks or we could

have the same tricks and all of these

will take the solver on a different

journey depending on what we want to do

you know if we want to be artful and we

want to have a certain

sort of a plan to create something

spectacular we can do that but we can

also just make something flowy and

simple and fast that

is easy to solve and players can get

through quickly it all depends on

what we're feeling like or or what we

want to do

let's see so that was the most recent

one that i put in i want that to force

something i haven't really decided what

we could we could try

something that can be interesting is is

to create uh

let's see here uh

well let's just try putting a two here

and and blocking off

a few things maybe that so that will

well do we want to have this so open i

guess that's okay

uh we'll force a few of these like that

and then maybe we can put one like that

we could even put a zero here which will

then mean we cannot put one there

something that's interesting sometimes

is to have a long row

where you can't put light bulbs anywhere

on them for example say i put a zero

here

and then let's see we can block this off

we don't need that

but then the zero will rule out all of

these and then if you look at this the

only place this can be illuminated is by

placing a light bulb here

uh boom and the only place where this

cell can be illuminated

by placing a light bulb in that cell

itself boom

maybe we can do this one more time

if we put a zero here then that will

rule out this and then the only way that

cell can be illuminated

is by putting a light bulb here uh

whoops

uh boom okay um

how's that working pretty good i didn't

need this for anything

maybe i want this light bulb to infer

something in the middle

trying to think of a good way to do that

um

did we need that maybe we could just

have

a two here

and then we will have to put two light

bulbs there and then maybe

this is where the final light bulb goes

to eliminate that one

and we can check our answer now uh you

know we we

erased and and re-added a bunch of

things so we really should check our

whole solution

in order to confirm that the the logic

flow is intact

and the way to do that is erase our

answer and do a complete test solve

so let's just pretend we're solving the

puzzle

you know i would do all this is there

anything i can deduce right now there

actually is i can put a light bulb here

because i know that this cell has to be

illuminated and nothing else can light

it up

you know does that spoil the aesthetic

of my puzzle going all the way around

well maybe i might decide to fix this or

i might decide i just don't care

that's fine but the intended first step

was here

and then we can get this light bulb uh

sometimes it's interesting to think like

what if the player doesn't see this move

like what if the solver just has to go

somewhere else can they make progress

elsewhere um like you might notice that

you can't put two here because that

would violate the one and we need

sort of two of these three to be lit up

and therefore this one

if it wasn't lit up would force this

which would be a contradiction and so

this one has to be lit up

does that help me move forward i'm not

sure i think i still need to know which

one of these two it is

and so that would allow me to make that

discovery

and then so we get that we get that we

said that would give us this which would

give us this

um and then this 2 gives us that

that one gives us those two which gives

us that

which then gives us this to sort of

force that which then gives us this to

force that and that's sort of just an

add-on

then those two which finally reveal

where that final light bulb in this row

has to go which is there

so most of our solution path is intact

there's maybe a few places where we

could skip ahead a little bit

do we want to go back back and fix it we

could if we were really trying to go for

a specific

uh look or a specific theme but

the point is you have a lot of freedom

as a puzzle designer to create that and

this method of designing from the front

or forward design allows you to really

have quite tight control

over the solution experience of the

person solving the puzzle

uh if you do it correctly and if you're

good at it which is is hard right like

i've been doing this for many years so i

have some experience with this and

you know i have a sense of like where it

could go wrong or what types of

assumptions i should and shouldn't make

when i'm making these

sort of you know when i'm adding a new

square to the grid how is this going to

affect the solution path based on what

i've created so far and you have to have

a good sense

of how these puzzles solve in order to

be able to do that so some of the best

composers of these puzzles are also the

best solvers of them

because they themselves are able to once

they place one thing in the grid they

can deduce

exactly all that can be deduced from it

and therefore have a really good

understanding of what the solver

experience is going to be

um with logic puzzles that's true

although it's less true with other types

of puzzles like crosswords um i think

there's a famous mike sellinger quote

where he says um you know making a good

crossword versus solving a crossword is

is like

arson versus firefighting and it's not

necessary that

the same person is going to be it's not

necessarily true that the same person is

going to be

good at both arson and firefighting

but with logic puzzles i think it often

is

anyways i'm going to close this

don't need to save it so designing from

the front has a number of benefits

uh you know you can control the flow you

can create these

playful setups and you can hide eureka

moments in really interesting ways

another thing that designing from the

front enables is this sort of deductive

solution where as a solver you're making

logical deductions you're never guessing

right like when you solve a sudoku you

generally aren't guessing you're putting

in a number once you're confident that

that's true

and that means that once you get to the

end and you found a unique solution

you're sort of aware that it is unique

because in solving the puzzle

deductively you have established that

uniqueness

and this can be a source of pleasure as

a solver because it's it's sort of like

the soundness and completeness meeting

together

implying that both the existence and

uniqueness of the puzzle have been

established

and that's different than a puzzle where

you guess and you find the answer and

you don't even know is this the unique

answer is this the only answer

you know this definitively is the unique

answer and you had to find it by sort of

going through

the the motions that were uh

intended for you to go through um and

and that is what enables this

communication because you know that this

is what the puzzle designer

intended you to do when you're solving

it and you're consciously aware of that

and the the puzzle designer is

surprising you with what the next step

is and how it's been laid out

and not just with the you know what the

actual solution is the

the surprising thing at the end of the

puzzle isn't what the final grid looks

like when it's done

it's what was the logic that enabled you

to deduce that that was the only way

it could be and that is is the thing

that elevates

these types of logic puzzles to a

greater aesthetic than a computer

generated sudoku

one of the important things to do is

make the key move or sort of the key

step that you have to do

provably unique if we go back to that

um chess puzzle by sam lloyd

king e2 is the only way to achieve that

made in three

and and the fact that that's true kind

of forces the puzzle

uh the puzzle forces the solver to

uncover the planned eureka moment

that has been set up um and in chess you

know

sometimes there's different responses

like if the player goes king e2

uh the opponent playing black does not

have to respond by queening the pawn the

player

the opponent can respond by just moving

a bishop or doing something else

right and in all of those cases the

player does have mate in three

but the most interesting part of the

puzzle is sort of what do you do against

the most challenging response

and so the fact that there's one key

move on the first move is essential in

all

chess puzzles it's sort of a requirement

of the genre there needs to be a single

unique

key move on turn one but then often in

subsequent turns it can sort of fork and

branch a little bit more depending on

what the opponent does

and it's not you know you need to kind

of find a response to

everything right so the fact that the

later part of the puzzle may not be

unique because of what the opponent can

do doesn't spoil the aesthetics of the

puzzle having a unique key move

puzzles that lack a unique key move are

often called

cooked puzzles meaning you know as in

his goose is cooked it's just like not a

good puzzle or it's not worthy of being

printed

a second solution is often called a duel

or

in video games i've heard it called an

exploit where the player can get around

the intended thing

that the developer was trying to force

them to do

but the player is somehow able to find

an exploit to avoid

doing this and if the purpose of your

puzzle is to conceal a unique

eureka moment then intentionally having

multiple solutions is not a good idea

and accidentally having multiple

solutions

may be a problem that you know you want

your qa to catch if you're doing puzzle

design you want to make sure that your

test solvers are really good at finding

those

multiple solutions and the way you want

them to do that is by by being deductive

solvers that can really try and

establish the uniqueness of every

solution by proving it

um and that's hard for some types of

puzzles especially

uh very stateful puzzles like block

pushing puzzles where there's a million

different states that the puzzle can be

in and it's often very hard

to determine that an alternative way of

solving the puzzle is impossible

you really want to as a puzzle designer

make sure you're slicing off those

rabbit trails and just

making it so that you don't have to

check too deep in order to

make sure that something doesn't happen

i can give you a million examples of

these

which i didn't include in the talk i

think

the one that sticks with me the most is

in steven's sausage roll they have this

level called the tower where there's

eight sausages stacked up and you have

to sort of set them up in this unique

way

um but the way i solved that puzzle was

not the intended way

and the way a number of people solved it

i've checked on youtube and twitch

videos was really not the intended way

um

i mean they ultimately got to the same

final state but the the sort of setup or

the way they went about going about the

setup to get there

uh can vary in a lot of ways and some of

the setups are

really convoluted like the thing that i

did was was kind of

really complex and annoying and and

difficult to set up and painful

whereas there was a nice intended

solution to the puzzle

but i never even saw it during my first

playthrough i basically had to cheat and

look up the answer before i learned what

the intended solution was

and i think my experience playing that

game would have been a lot better if i

had

been coerced toward the intended

solution more

strongly anyways

like deductive puzzles kind of need to

have unique solutions because

the the flow demands that you sort of

prove

every step you're not guessing right so

you need to be able to prove every step

that you move forward on and therefore

you have to just end up with one

solution at the end

you wouldn't be able to have deductive

flow if the solution wasn't unique

um so many types of puzzles chess

puzzles logic puzzles etc demand

solutions

but many other types of puzzles ought to

have unique solutions

because of the aesthetics and because of

the need to have a unique eureka moment

and to force that on the player unique

solutions are just a way to facilitate

that

so i advocate uniqueness whenever

somebody asks me

you know and for those point-and-click

adventure games that have multiple

solutions to some puzzles

that can be okay like there are there

are many downsides right like you're

you're doing extra work that the player

might not even see

um sometimes you'll end up with an extra

item and not even know what it was for

um you know like like oh that was for

the second possible

solution to that puzzle and you never

used it like like you want to have this

feeling of every item in the game having

had a purpose right like i got that

thing what was it for

um if you leave the game without feeling

that you understood that purpose then

sometimes it can feel a little

incomplete or it feels like

you know the communication was lost at

some point um

you know so there's there's a lot to

think about with regards to uniqueness

moving on let's talk about themes

adding a theme to puzzles can bring

value in many different ways

one example that i will give are are

burr puzzles

or or kamiki puzzles kumiki puzzles are

japanese animal themed burr puzzles

i have one right here this is sort of

themed as a pig

uh i can show you too it's it's a cool

puzzle it's cute it's not particularly

difficult but it has this move where you

have to press the nose in and then

that's

what's required to sort of get out the

first piece uh

you press the nose in and it's it's just

kind of quaint and clever

um as opposed to just a regular old burr

puzzle

which is uh you know just a bunch of

wooden sticks that you have to notch

together there's there's something a

little bit more

and uh it can also help you kind of

remember what you're doing like when you

have the pieces laid out on the table

and you're trying to put this thing back

together

um you realize well okay that's the ears

that's the legs that's the

you know the the language of where

things go and how things fit together

uh can somehow uh be easier if the theme

is there

uh i'll show you a couple of other

examples these are slither links

on the left is one by circonurekly and

this was done

for the indian national puzzle

championship

uh maybe like six seven years ago i it's

done in the theme of i'm not sure if

it's a lily pad or a lotus flower or

some kind of

uh elaborate geometric design but that

design

actually makes the slitherling puzzle

more interesting like there is a vertex

of degree

17 in the middle of this puzzle which

you know you never see in a normal

uh slither link with square geometry and

sort of these two twos over here and the

way they

uh relate to this degree high degree

vertex in the middle that's actually

the break into this puzzle the essential

part of the solution is to kind of

work out how that might function um

and so it's it's not just aesthetic for

the sake of aesthetics it also

lends itself to the solution the puzzle

which is amazing

the one on the right is a um

slither link puzzle where the 0 1 2 and

3 numbers

have been replaced by the the four

letters

m-o-m-o-a-y in some order

and figuring out that order is part of

the puzzle um

and this was also published on mother's

day on grandmaster puzzles and it has

the words mama

mama mommy you know in in in a bunch of

uh corners of the grid you know mama is

there like it's

it's just kind of cute and clever and

interesting but it's also a valid

slitherlink

uh and you know it just adds some little

bit of extra sparkle or spice to this

puzzle

um another benefit is like when you're

creating these puzzles

sometimes you know it's like a blank

page you don't know what to do what you

want to create and coming up with a good

theme

can lead you in the direction of uh

concretizing your ideas and having some

kind of uh

you know key thing to frame your puzzle

around like themes allow you to

have a purpose to your puzzle beyond

just you know make one more of the same

type of

logic puzzle or crossword puzzle or

you know wood puzzle whatever it is

you're making

so you get this additional aesthetic

value but but it's also useful as a

constructor to be able to have them

it also makes the puzzles more memorable

because you know everybody knows oh that

like 17 degrees slitherlink or that

mother's day puzzle right it it

uh gives a short description to the

puzzle and

allows it to have a place in your brain

where it sort of sticks out

the converse to that is don't be clever

in ways that the solver will never

notice

uh there are some themes that people

think of as an idea for a crossword that

uh

maybe make the crossword worse here's a

crossword

uh it's it's actually quite a remarkable

construction

it is a quintuple pangram meaning every

letter of the alphabet from a to z

has been used five times in this grid so

you will notice there are five

queues in the grid there are five x's

and there are five zeds

um and five j's and so on like

so really uh the constructor here had to

get in a lot of

interesting words you could see like so

five qs means there are ten

keywords in this uh crossword because

they are both across

and down um so you know there's there's

barbecue and square feet and

quirk and quack and quintuple and quick

and down quark uh q-tip right so a lot

of

interesting and flavorful q words but

there's also some words that are kind of

not

that great that that you wouldn't want

in a crossword there's there's

dxix for example like what what is that

uh i will show you in a moment um let's

i'll share this quote with you which is

from the late nancy solomon who passed

away just a couple of months ago she is

a

godmother to all crossword creators with

her famous

sage advice uh blog um

you know she she shares that a plethora

of x's zed's cues and jays and the like

will buy you nothing but

rejections if you pay too high a price

for them um

and so here's a couple of examples one

clue is albuquerque's home and the

answer is

nmex like it's supposed to be the state

of new mexico

but who writes nmex for new mexico like

you might write nm

uh this is kind of a weird abbreviation

that feels

kind of off and wrong and is that really

the answer you want in your crossword

you know the dxix is is 519 in old rome

it is a roman numeral clue

and let me tell you that the the number

of times you've seen these if you've

been doing crosswords long enough it

always elicits a groan

and it's always like well i guess if you

had to

if you really had to but like putting

numbers

in a crossword grid is kind of you know

once you've seen it once you've seen it

and like the point is you're paying

sort of in the sparkle and the

liveliness of the clues and the quality

of the fill

uh in order to achieve this goal of a

quintuple pangram

so the question is like you know what is

what are you willing to do

for your art right and are you making

this as something that is designed to be

pleasurable for the solver or are you

making this as a work of art

maybe if if you're making this as a work

of art then it's worth it

um but if your goal is to make it as

something that's pleasurable for the

solver then you've got to be a little

bit careful

um this puzzle is by david c duncan

decker and it is a remarkable puzzle

um and i think that as far as a

quintuple pan gram goes it's not

that bad like there's actually some good

words in here it's

mostly lively fill there's not

too many like really tenuous ones but

there are some and it's just unavoidable

when you're trying to achieve a goal

this lofty i can think of all the

puzzles that i've like

wasted hours and hours trying to finish

um it was because i was trying to

achieve some kind of aesthetic goal that

was just not cooperating and i tried one

thing and it didn't work tried another

thing didn't work and constantly having

to back

out and a lesson hard learned is to

not make your goals too difficult and

especially not to compromise on the

quality of the puzzle in order to

achieve them

i will show you one more example this is

the cast elk puzzle

where is it i had it on my desk at some

point

is it on my shelf

it's hiding my my desk has a lot of

stuff on it where is it there it is okay

uh here we go so this is a puzzle called

the cast elk it's published by hanayama

uh it's actually a really cool puzzle so

there's these two

uh they're basically interlocked

semicircular sort of c-shaped rings that

are themed like a deer with

antlers or an elk i guess you know is

what it's called and you kind of have to

slip them past each other and then sort

of like

rotate them sideways a bit and then they

come apart

and you can reverse that to push them

back together the thing that's

interesting about these is that

well my my spouse alissa had this as a

teenager

and she was able to solve the puzzle but

she never

actually noticed the trick and the trick

is that when you have these

two things together um and you try to

slip when you try to do this move

it actually most of the time will not

work uh and it's because

these uh sort of tips of the antlers

uh are not all the same length uh there

are

two antler tips in this that are shorter

than all of the rest

and when you have this interlock c shape

there's four kind of ways of

taking it apart that seem like they're

isometric but they're actually not

because the antlers are not the same

length so

my spouse spent her teenage years not

realizing why sometimes she could solve

this puzzle and sometimes not

and when you go to put it back together

it's even worse because there's actually

eight possible ways of putting it

together only one of which works

um and so it's kind of like a cruel joke

played by the puzzle designer

and if you're in on it it's great you

know once you know the secret it seems

clever but when you're solving it it

just seems kind of

like a bit baffling and it can leave you

with this feeling of like not really

understanding what the intent of the

puzzle designer was

um and so i i think the the lesson is

that it would be great if after you

solved this puzzle you could sort of

open a fortune cookie and learn

by the way the secret is this um because

understanding that secret is sort of

having the eureka moment and if you

solve the puzzle without having a eureka

moment then

uh part of the aesthetic value of that

puzzle is lost on you

and i can't count the number of times

where i've i've watched somebody solve a

video game puzzle and they accidentally

find the solution and move on and

they're sort of missing out on the

beauty that lies within that puzzle

because they haven't discovered

that the deeper secret lying within and

i mean many video game puzzles simply do

not have a deeper a deeper secret lying

within

uh but when they do i think you know

my goal is always to allow the player to

experience that deeper secret to let

them in on the joke to sort of maximize

their exposure to the eureka moment even

if it means

telling them afterwards what is the

thing that they were supposed to have

figured out

um because to me experiencing the eureka

moment is the important part of the

puzzle

now maybe you want to leave that secret

in there maybe you want it to be

something that somebody can come back to

maybe you want it to be

you know a book that when you read it

the second time you uh

learn a little bit more there's a little

bit of depth that you can uncover

in the second reading right that that

could be an option too but it's just

something to think about

um and and you know that's that's

the end of this example i guess um next

lesson is the format

changes everything i want to show you a

few examples of puzzles that are

almost all the same these are all

puzzles where you have to

draw a path that sort of goes through

everything on the grid and so on this

left this is a puzzle called simple loop

it's a paper-based logic puzzle you have

to draw a loop that passes through every

tile

um exactly once not including the shaded

ones

this one on the bottom left is from a

game called blossom tails

and it's sort of the same puzzle except

there's an entrance at the top and an

exit at the bottom

this one in the middle is from the

witness and it's the same except there's

an entrance and an exit and you only

have to collect all the dots you don't

actually have to visit sort of every

vertex of the grid this one on the right

has

multiple entrances and exits and you may

not know where they are this is from

a mobile puzzle game called alcazar

and it seems like they're all similar

but there's actually a lot of

differences

in the solver experience when you're

solving these puzzles

um you know the the modality of your

input

and the output that you're being shown

right whether you're seeing a screen or

seeing something physically in front of

you or doing something on paper uh

whether you're using even controller

versus keyboard mouse versus touch they

all provide different affordances like

can you click and drag do you have to

move a cursor around to select which

square you're on

are you on a small screen or a big

screen how big is the text of your

puzzle

um can you undo and restart can you save

your progress on paper you have to

literally use an eraser but you can also

use multiple colors of pencils to maybe

make a guess and try something out and

then you know

what you want to erase uh when you're

uh done making that guess and decided

that's not the way forward

um some video games have undo systems

where you can make a move and go back

some don't

some are brutal blossom tales actually

if you step off the path onto those red

zones you take damage and you have to

restart

and there's no undo meaning that if you

don't solve the puzzle correctly on the

first try you actually

are hurt um you know when i got to this

puzzle i literally just print screened

it and turned it into ms paint and

solved it in there

um punishment of mistakes is is sort of

uh an interesting aspect like some

puzzle games if you go back to the early

uh like early 90s chips challenge style

puzzly adventure games which had some

real time and some turn-based elements

many of those games were very punishing

like if you stepped the wrong way

you'd have to completely restart the

whole level you'd lose a life it was

very frustrating

um nowadays i think fewer games have

that aesthetic

and they're more uh you know they're

more about solving the puzzles about

their eureka moments and they allow undo

and reset and you can often even undo

your reset

which can be useful if you hit it by

mistake um

another big one is note taking and we'll

get to this in the next section but but

essentially what i mean by note-taking

is

in the witness you just have to draw a

line from the start to the end you can't

sort of draw a partial line on the

corner of the grid whereas in alcazar

the way you're making progress is by

um sort of adding little bits of lines

slowly until you've drawn in the whole

path and the experience of solving those

two puzzles is very different

note taking can increase depth and this

is you know an

important enough uh lesson to be a

number of its own

i want to show you an example in sudoku

and then we will go back to the path

drawing puzzles

a lot of players have had different ways

of doing sudoku notation but they're

sort of three that are most in in common

use

uh and many sudoku solvers are using all

three of these notations at once

they're sort of candidate notation

meaning this cell must contain one of

these numbers you know seven two means

this cell is either a seven or a two uh

snyder notation

is sort of the reverse it's this number

goes in one of these cells like here's a

box

the two in this box goes in one of these

cells and sometimes you sort of draw a

two

on the border between two boxes it's

sometimes called a by value there's

different ways that people do it and

annotate it and then there are colors

which means these two cells are the same

number but i don't know which one they

are yet

um and this is an example from cracking

the cryptic where here mark goodlife is

is filling out this grid and hasn't put

in a single number yet or he's just put

in his first number which is a seven

over here

uh in this thermometer and uh it took

him 30 minutes to get this far but after

he put in that seven he was then able to

finish the whole puzzle in less than a

minute because

as soon as you get one number the whole

thing collapses um

but this type of puzzle would not be

solvable without note taking like you

can't

solve it the way you would in normal

sudoku where you're just putting in one

number then the next then the next then

the next then the next you need to be

able to take notes and sort of reduce

the possibility

space down from this large you know so

many things could be the answer down to

only these things could be the answer

and then from there you realize ah this

number has to go there

um and so the eureka moments that are

possible with note taking are much

deeper than those without it

let's go back to the witness this is an

example from it's very early in the game

in fact that you see this puzzle and

there's multiple start locations

multiple places where you could possibly

end it the the goal is basically you

have to draw a single line from

one of those start locations to an end

location that both passes through all

these black hexagons

as well as um well it has to cut

the light and dark cells uh so that they

don't live in the same connected

component and there's a long

uh you know definition of what that

really is but it sort of is like

keeping all the light cells on the left

and dark cells on the right or vice

versa

it's it's similar to that um and if you

sort of take this puzzle into ms paint

you could

kind of draw in some little bits of

deductive analysis of where the path

must go and from here you can actually

solve the puzzle pretty easily

uh but that's sort of not really the way

this puzzle is designed right

it's not a puzzle where you can enter

partial bits of progress while playing

it

um it's it's a puzzle game where you

sort of start at the beginning and then

draw a line out and it goes through

everything and exits

this isn't necessarily a bad thing but

it does

limit the complexity of the types of

puzzles that you could create in the

witness

like if you go back to this alcazar

puzzle on the right hand side here

you could never make this in the puzzle

in the witness because it would just be

too frustrating for players like they

would literally need to print screen it

and go into paint because you can't

necessarily solve it

start to end uh without making a mistake

um it's just sort of too much for the

player's working memory to be able to do

that in their

head right it's it's too big of a grid

for you to be able to head solve

and so the witness fundamentally limits

itself to

smaller grids because it wants to you

know have grids that people can head

solve

rather than grids that people are going

to need to take a million notes for but

that sort of limits

how deep and interesting those puzzles

can be now that said

taking notes isn't necessarily a good

fit for the theme of the witness the

witness is fundamentally a game about

drawing a line from one place to the

next and not a game about

note-taking when you're solving logic

puzzles um so i

i think the witnesses approach is

correct for what the witness is trying

to do

um but i'm just saying it does create

some limitation in what types of puzzles

can be expressed or or you know can be

expressed in a way that's convenient for

the solver

to access without copy pasting the

puzzle into ms paint

or taking notes on paper or trying to

keep

way too many things in their head at

once

some puzzles are basically designed such

that note taking

is the solution to the puzzle

mindsweeper is one of them if you try

solving mindsweeper without noting the

minds

it's really hard but also even just

noting where the numbers are that is the

form of progress of the puzzle like note

taking is progress it feels like

progress

uh for these types of zebra crossing or

einstein's riddle type puzzles where

they give you a bunch of

uh sort of logical hints and then you

have to fill

in the grid like you know who had the

milk who had the water

you know who was what color etc

those types of puzzles that the note

taking is the progress it's what you're

doing when you're solving the puzzle and

this is often true

of many types of logic puzzles and paper

logic puzzles

and it is a tradition that isn't used as

much

in video game puzzles that sort of rely

more on statefulness and interaction

because that you know this is a natural

fit to pen and paper

it's less of a natural fit when you're

playing a game and moving a character

around in three-dimensional space

but they do a good job of making

note-taking feel like progress and

that's how they're able to access their

depth in a way that isn't

too annoying related to that beware of

the temptations offered by the

interactive

medium um you know there are certain

things that players are often or

sorry that puzzle creators and video

games are often tempted to put in their

puzzles

that uh especially sort of novice puzzle

designers in video games uh would

possibly be advised to avoid

and i say this with a lot of deliberate

nuance um

but one example is physics um you know

if you have unity or unreal or whatever

there's this physics in the game it's

very tempting to just use those built-in

physics systems

as ways to create puzzles you know you

have rolling balls you have cubes that

move under gravity

you can can place on buttons or be

placed to jump on etc

um the problem is that puzzles are often

about

eureka moments that are sort of about

discrete state spaces you know what

is necessary in order to get here or to

do this

and physics lives in a continuous space

and sometimes

it's just not as nice to reason about a

continuous space as a discrete one you

know if you're trying to like

aim a thing to see if you know the ball

can get over there

sometimes it's not clear like can the

ball make it over there or or can it not

you know did i just aim it wrong i need

to aim a little higher or

move a little closer or is it

fundamentally impossible

and sort of the projection from that

continuous space down to that discrete

space

removes the clarity of the solver when

they're trying to analyze the puzzle and

what to do

if your goal is to make a clear game

that presents its you

your that presents its uniqueness

moments with as clear state of possible

that as possible then physics can be a

thing that makes that harder another

thing that can make it harder is

statefulness

um the paper-based puzzles you know

they're they're stateless in the sense

that there aren't things moving around

there's not blocks that you can push

they are just

you know provide the answer to this

puzzle they are they are puzzles where

you have to supply a certificate that

obeys certain mathematical rules

um whereas if you have a block pushing

puzzle like sokobon

that puzzle can be in a lot of different

states depending on where the boxes are

and it's often very difficult to reason

about what can and cannot be done or

what is and is not possible

because of the complexity of that state

space

statefulness can make it harder to

understand that this eureka moment was

necessary or that i had to move through

this bottleneck because it just seems

like there are so many things to try

and achieving the sort of clarity

of a puzzle with a unique eureka moment

is much harder when

the state space of your puzzle is

exponentially large because you have

you know 10 different boxes all of which

can be moved around

linearity i already mentioned and plot

driven puzzle games fits into there

because you often

have the urge to make them linear if

your puzzles come in a linear sequence

where one depends on the previous and

depends on the previous game designers

tend to gravitate towards this because

they like the idea of one idea building

upon an old one and building upon

another one and getting

more interesting and more complex it's

used in a lot of different types of game

design

the problem when doing that with puzzles

is again a blocking player progress

if the player gets stuck and they can't

advance then they may not have anything

else to do other than look up the

solution

and you know having to sand off the

difficulty or the challenges or the

interestingness of your puzzles in order

to preserve player throw

flow through the linearity

you know that can be a tough decision to

make because maybe that precious eureka

moment that you want it to have

is not going to be as impactful because

you've had to stick it in a puzzle where

it's just spoon fed to the player

you know maybe that's the design you're

going for and that's fine maybe you're

going for a low difficulty game

but if you're trying to make challenging

puzzles i would really strongly advise

you not to make a linear game and look

at

look towards talos principle the witness

anti-chamber

uh so i think many of the most

successful puzzle games of the last

decade

were non-linear in their structure of

the sort of prerequisite chain of

puzzles

um and it's something to look towards

now the problem with this advice

is this this is this advice uh has been

violated by the most successful puzzle

game

uh of 10 years ago and uh

so many puzzle game developers i've seen

hop onto these trends they try to make a

portal like they make a linear puzzle

game based on physics and statefulness

uh you know and they have a unique

narrative beat that's sort of delivered

every time you go into the next room and

and you have to solve one puzzle after

another the problem is

uh if you're not valve and you don't

have valve level resources developing

your game

uh then you may find it difficult

to control the experience in a way that

makes players always eager to press on

like you're either gonna have something

that's too difficult in which case

players will become discouraged they'll

look up the answer they won't

have that experience of finding the

eureka moments for themselves

or the puzzle will be so devoid of

interest or challenge because you've

sent it off all the difficulty you know

portal 2 i think sometimes feels like

it's focus tested to a fault

every time a player must have got stuck

on a puzzle they added a light in a

corner or an arrow pointing to this part

of the room or a

you know uh a glados uh or or

you know other character a bark where

the character kind of tells you what to

look at and what to look for and some

players find this insulting or they find

it kind of

spoiling the the experience they want

out of the puzzle game right

um but those concessions are necessary

when you're making a long linear story

based puzzle game of that complexity

um so again be aware of the trade-offs

but i would strongly advise people not

to copy portal 2

if they're not valve and you know are

less confident in what they're doing

uh non-linearity solves a lot of

problems

and even if you want to do a story

driven game you can still have story

driven beats in a non-linear game you

just have to be a bit more creative

about how you

deliver those beats you know

there's lots of games that have done

that and done it well next

lesson break the rules sometimes

perversely

so i think a lot of puzzles are

memorable because they broke

one of the rules that i have mentioned

previously in this talk i'll show you a

few examples

this is the clinton bob dole crossword

very famous from 1996. this was

literally

on election day

and this puzzle does not have a unique

answer

there are two possible answers for 39

across they are clinton and bob dole

and uh you know i think the clue for 39

across

was with 43 across tomorrow's newspaper

headline

and so 39 plus 43 a cross is either

clinton elected or bob dole elected

um and then they had two other cute uh

clues

one at 17 across was you know what this

puzzle is making or something like that

prognostication

and 68 across is mr president it's it's

kind of cute

um but how did they do this well all of

the down

clues that cross clinton and bob dole

have to have two answers that work for

both of them

and so down here 39 down you get cat

down here 39 down you get bat and the

clue was

black halloween animal which which has

both cat and bat as answers

these are called schrodinger clues

another example is french 101 word is

either louis

or we a sewing shop purchase is either

yarn or

yard

boast or blast i think was trumpet um

and you know so there's there's a lot of

cleverness in designing clues that work

with two possible answers

that themselves are one letter apart

where the one letter is the difference

between clinton and bob dole like this

is a work of art this is spectacular

um just a wonderful and exciting puzzle

that

through violating the rule of have a

unique answer

becomes something even more i'll show

you another puzzle

this is called x-ray fish it's from the

galactic puzzle hunt from 2017.

i believe if i click this it will

actually show it to you this puzzle

is a video uh

is it going to play i don't know if it's

actually going to play i was hoping it

would i tested this okay there we go

okay there it is and it has music right

like this this thing is kind of crazy

so it's got all of these different fish

in it that are moving around

um it it turns out that the thing you

had to do to solve this puzzle

was count the number of each types of

fish and figure out what they all were

and then the numbers were sort of

indices into words which then made a

secret message it was crazy

um except there was one fish that you

were not supposed to count

and those were the red herrings

which uh which were intentional red

herrings in the puzzle

but the fact that they themselves were

red herrings is sort of

a joke it's a bit of humor it's it's

itself a source of sparkle in the puzzle

right so the the the rule of don't put

red herrings in your puzzle is somehow

flipped on its head by

deliberately putting red herrings on the

puzzle in sort of a cute way

uh and i i've always remembered that

because i thought it was funny i've also

seen escape rooms where they literally

have like a fish

on the wall and it's a giant red herring

uh at

2021 mit mystery hunt there was a puzzle

that you had to put together

uh made of puzzle pieces and the answer

was a giant red herring and it turned

out that what mattered in that puzzle

was whether or not the puzzle pieces

went in or went out you know whether

they were innies or audis

that was actually the information you

needed from the puzzle

uh and so to illustrate that the picture

itself wasn't relevant the picture was

made of red herring

somewhat perversely but it's hilarious

here's the slitherlink example this is

one of mine although the trick is not

original to me it's been seen before

usually when you have two threes next to

each other in a slither length there's

only two possible things that could

happen with it

either they go like this or they go like

this

because there's just nothing else that

can work with the two threes

the problem is when you try to solve it

in either one of those two ways you run

into a problem you sort of start

navigating

around the board and you just hit a dead

end you can't get through

and actually the solution is this

which you know you can only really do

this once you can only do it on a small

puzzle

but there it is you know for the once in

your lifetime

the thing you're doing with two threes

and a slither link is not the typical

one

um take from that what you will but

again violating

in a perverse manner the sort of rules

and conventions of the genre

can lead to a bit of excitement or

delight

let me show you one more this is a chess

puzzle by

pal banco who is uh he was a chess

grandmaster and also a prolific

uh chess composer uh one of the greats

and this is a delightful one it's from a

book

uh called chess brain twisters which uh

was compiled together by a birch uh bert

hatchberg who was i think he was editor

of chess and life magazine

or um you know he basically got exposed

to a lot of these

different unique and interesting chess

puzzles and uh

the book has been reprinted under a

different title called

outrageous chess problems uh or maybe

outrageous chess puzzles i can't

remember it is this is honestly my

favorite puzzle book in the universe

above all logic puzzle books everything

else it's a glorious book

and it contains chess puzzles that are

so

absurd uh you know they're jaw-dropping

absurdities this one right here

is a puzzle where the stipulation is

both sides must collaborate

to not checkmate black so it's not just

white trying not to checkmate it's both

sides collaborating

uh and so what's going on here well

first of all white has very few moves to

make

like this knight can move uh but if you

move it down there you'll literally put

black into checkmate so you can't do

that

this pawn can move but if you push it

forward guess what you've checkmated

black

you can move this pawn up and then you

know the question is okay well what's

black gonna do black can

move this uh pawn down here and queen it

but by queening this pawn

uh black will put white into check which

white will be forced to block with this

knight moving down there which then puts

black into checkmate so you somehow have

to find a sequence of moves

that will not result in checkmate uh and

in fact this pawn

can go all the way up and promote uh to

a queen which would checkmate but maybe

you want to under promote to a bishop or

a knight

the problem is if you promote it to a

knight the only place it has to move is

here

which checkmate's black if you promote

it to a bishop the only place it has to

move is here

which checkmate's black so it's this

really unique situation where

it seems like no matter what happens

black is heading for a checkmate in

three

and there is a way to stop it i will

leave it to you to find it uh but it's a

remarkable and hilarious puzzle not

necessarily because of the solution just

because of the construction and the

stipulation and i

i think this may be a unique stipulation

i've never seen another help not mate

uh but such a clever and interesting

idea that i will always remember

so the last lesson is about serendipity

and about how to find unique and

interesting

constructions for puzzles and that is

that serendipity occurs when you are

actively searching for good ideas

um you know one thing that is common is

that great puzzles are often discovered

not invented but you have to be looking

out for those discoveries constantly

when you're sort of

working on puzzles i will show you one

example this is from our upcoming game

and it was

uh you know i would say created but

almost i would say it was discovered

by one of our puzzle authors when they

were working with a new type of clue

that we had just added to the game

and i'll show you what the puzzle is

basically uh

whoops let's see if we can open this

um the the way this puzzle system works

is there are sort of different types of

of clues that can go into it

um and you can color the cells in the

grid either dark or light colored

um but there are a couple of rules one

is that the white cells have to be

connected orthogonally meaning that you

know if these are light-colored cells

and we make dark cells like this

then this would disconnect the

light-colored part of the grid so that

is not allowed it's it's similar to

um some other puzzles like

uh i don't know nurikabe puzzles the

dark cells all have to be connected here

the light cells have to be connected

the other rules are there certain

patterns that you have to avoid you

cannot have two dark cells adjacent

and you cannot have four light cells

adjacent and then finally this one in a

region means exactly one cell in that

area is darkened

so this one could be dark and then the

rest could be light or this one could be

dark and the rest could be light

and it turns out from just this there is

a unique solution to this puzzle

and i'll i'll show you the start of the

solution and basically you look at this

region and you think well okay let's try

putting a dark cell there and then these

all have to be light well because of the

no

four in a row rule these two then have

to be dark but we said that the dark

cells can't be adjacent to one another

so that's impossible therefore that one

can't be the dark cell

and similarly none of these other out

one outer ones on the periphery can be

dark so in fact the middle one is the

dark cell

and then you get a lot of three in a row

so you have to block off all of the

possible four in a rows and then you

can't have two dark cells adjacent to

one another so these ones all have to be

light

and then i mean the light cells all have

to be connected so you you this light

cell has to move upwards

if this was dark then this light cell

would be disconnected for everything so

that's light

and then this cell here you know if

there was four in a row here then that

would violate the rule so this cell has

to be dark

and then this light area has to escape

so it's got to go out here and then

there's three in a row here so that one

has to be dark and we just keep going

there's three in a row here

this puzzle doesn't stop the the logic

of how you solve this thing

just keeps flowing and it turns out that

from this

initial just you know one in a square in

the corner

there's a unique solution to this puzzle

and it's quite remarkable

uh and i asked the creator of this his

name is jeffrey barton

how he came upon this and he says i

don't know i just just got lucky i just

found it i was just kind of i put this

one region in because i thought the one

region was kind of interesting and was

very forcing

and then i realized that you could

really get a lot from it

and i found a place to put it where

there was just one single unique

solution

and that was remarkable it was amazing

and everybody who test solved this

puzzle remarked that like this is a

fantastic puzzle this is very exciting

there's another example called the

miracle sudoku which was done by

mitchell lee

you can look it up on youtube it's one

of the most famous sudoku

puzzles on youtube it has only two

givens and it has some extra rules like

for example

uh numbers that are knights move away

from each other cannot be the same

there's there's some additional

extra rules but using only two givens

the whole puzzle can be solved

and the youtube video um

the solver uh he's a guy named simon on

cracking the cryptic

he can't believe that this thing has a

solution he thinks

that somebody's joking with him that

somebody has pranked him and when he

finally realizes that this puzzle

actually works his jaw hits the floor

um fantastic video highly encourage you

to watch it

um but you know the question again how

do you make these discoveries

um one thing is to notice your own

eureka moments

and turn them into puzzles uh but

another thing is

just be actively searching for things

that seem like

there might be more there than you

expect another example

jonathan blow was talking about this

puzzle from the witness and somebody

asked him

how did you get it to work and this

particular puzzle is

quite remarkable essentially you're

solving a grid puzzle which

simultaneously is making

paths on the floor that you can walk on

and you can only edit the blue part of

the grid from one side and you can only

edit the orange part of the grid from

the other side and you actually have to

physically walk on the path to get to

the other side

to be able to edit the other one and you

have to go back and forth like five

times in order to actually get to the

final state of this puzzle

um but the the sort of journey you're

taking when doing that

is remarkable and the fact that it works

at all seems

outlandish outstanding like like

somebody must have been a genius to put

this thing together

and no doubt this is a very clever and

very

uh beautifully crafted puzzle but when

john was asked

how he was able to figure this out he

kind of said well you know i started

putting stuff together and then towards

the end he kind of just got a bit lucky

um you know the fact that you had to go

back and forth five times the fact that

that kind of just worked out you know he

was just able to make it work

um and it's kind of difficult sometimes

to learn why you were able to make it

work it just turned out that way

and this type of serendipity happens a

lot when you're creating puzzles

sometimes you will just

find that you're able to do something a

little bit remarkable or even more

remarkable than you thought every puzzle

creator has had moments

in their life or in their career of

creating puzzles where for whatever

reason they were able to

like obtain an unexpectedly exciting or

fantastic

result because it just happened to work

out and

as a puzzle creator i think that one of

the most important lessons is to be

actively looking for these opportunities

and seize them

i will give you a quote from ralph

peters who's uh i think he's the founder

of smart games or he's one of the guys

who's created a lot of puzzle for smart

games

um this is one of his puzzles penguins

on ice and in describing

this puzzle he talked about uh how he

came upon the theme for it why

it was sort of these these penguins uh

on ice

as sort of a pentomino puzzle and

there's a unique mechanic where these

pentominos can

slide next to each other so that

polyamino can go from an f pentomino to

a p

pentomino to a w pentomino as sort of

these two blocks

up top slide over here and over here and

and this one as well this block sort of

slides up and down so it could be a y

pentomino or an l pentomino

um and you know this is the quote the

most

important idea is you don't find good

ideas by luck

you find them by actively searching for

them and actively trying hard to

recognize the potential in the things

you discover

often one small innovation isn't that

valuable but a combination of many small

things may produce something that brings

your creation to a whole new level

and he was referencing um the theme of

the puzzle and why he chose to make it

penguins and ice

um one thing is that the penguins

uh made it clear that there was a top in

the bottom so it made clear that the

puzzles could not be flipped

the sliding allowed the pieces to reach

more configurations which made

a more possible instances of the puzzle

the way the puzzle works by the way is

you get a card that shows you where the

penguins ultimately have to be in the

finished puzzle and then you have to

find

a way to slide the ice blocks and build

the puzzle so that the penguins lie in

the right spots

but like there's a lot of pentomino

puzzles out there and he wanted to make

one that had fewer moving parts so that

it was easier to manufacture and less

frightening and didn't seem like a

really complicated puzzle he wanted it

to look

simple and be more elegant and the

sliding

added back the interestingness that was

lost when the number of puzzles were

removed

um and sort of the theme made it less

abstract and sort of more fun and

playful and by putting all of these

things together

he was able to create something that was

far more exciting and compelling and

interesting

than just a pentomino puzzle where

you're putting blocks in a grit

and the sort of synergy of the theme

with the idea that you can't flip them

over with the playfulness and the

sliding of the puzzle and somehow ice

sliding into different configurations

feels like it makes sense

um it just ends up being more than the

sum of its parts

and that idea was a combination of many

small things that each in and of

themselves wasn't that valuable but

somehow

added up to a really great result and

the way he was able to do this

you know he chalks it all down to just

being alert

and looking for those things uh trying

really hard to recognize the potential

in every little possible innovation you

might see

um and that's something that as a puzzle

creator you're

constantly doing for your whole career

you're trying to notice the little

eureka moments that you're having when

playing around with the parts

and uh trying to find ways to

cultivate more depth from those eureka

moments

so that's the end of the talk this is

the sort of summary slide

where we show all of the uh

the tips or the lessons or the rules um

you know we've been here a while this is

the extended sort of director's cut

version of this talk

there's a lot there um you know if you

if you came from the gdc talk

uh i knew it was a bit rushed i

apologize it's hard to cram all this

stuff into an hour

uh here it feels like i've had a bit

more room to breathe and more to give a

bit more nuance and discussion to the

topics uh if you like this stuff i will

probably be making more videos on it in

the future although i don't know how

soon because

game number three is is very uh

demanding of my time right now

but um yeah that's that's sort of the

puzzle design

uh gdc talk or extended version of it uh

i hope this was useful uh i love talking

about any and all things puzzle related

uh please

contact me i love playing demos of

puzzle games or betas

or early access games

i love giving feedback on them so

please share them with me and i would

love to share with you my thoughts

if you are a puzzle designer and you are

looking for a job in video games

talk to me i've gotten lots of puzzle

designers jobs in video games i've also

hired many of them myself

um either way talk to me and

yeah that's that's the end of the talk

have a good one
