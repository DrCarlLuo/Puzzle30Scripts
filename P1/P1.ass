Dialogue: 1,0:24:51.96,0:24:57.47,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果你在填字游戏中看到"绿色油漆"这个词，你就会想，为什么要把这两个词连在一起
Dialogue: 2,0:24:57.47,0:25:03.36,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like you could stick any two words there and as a compound it's not really more meaningful than the sum of its parts.
Dialogue: 1,0:24:57.47,0:25:03.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你能把任何两个词粘在一起作为复合词，但它并没有真正地比单独这两个词有更多的意义

Dialogue: 2,0:25:14.43,0:25:20.32,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but like are you just putting that in your crossword because you needed to sort of make the words fit.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:14.43,0:25:20.32,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但你只是因为需要凑成一个整体，就把这些东西放到你的填字游戏里面

Dialogue: 1,0:25:26.84,0:25:31.13,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}关于"Natick"是什么以及为什么它被称为"Natick"，这背后有一个很长的故事
Dialogue: 2,0:25:31.13,0:25:38.68,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}But it's from Rex Parker's crossword blog where one time he literally finished the entire crossword except for one letter.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:31.13,0:25:38.68,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这来自Rex Parker的填字游戏博客，有一次他基本完成了整个填字游戏，就差一个字母
Dialogue: 2,0:25:38.68,0:25:45.02,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}And it was the first letter in Natick was missing and the horizontal word there was like the name of some actress that he had never heard of.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:38.68,0:25:45.02,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}就差Natick的首字母，但这个字母连着的一个横排单词又是一个他从没听说过的女演员的名字
Dialogue: 2,0:25:45.02,0:25:47.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}So, he just like didn't know what that one letter was
Dialogue: 1,0:25:45.02,0:25:47.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以他没办法解出那个字母是什么
Dialogue: 2,0:25:47.64,0:25:55.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, this there's this rule and crossword that you should never have two unguessable names that are crossing one another and sharing a letter.
Dialogue: 1,0:25:47.64,0:25:55.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以设计填字游戏中有这样一个规则，不应该有两个难以猜测的词相互交叉并共享一个字母

Dialogue: 2,0:26:03.64,0:26:12.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}The only thing wrong with this clue is that well it's a popular grocery store chain in the eastern half of the United States and around LA.
Dialogue: 1,0:26:03.64,0:26:12.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}把它作为谜题的唯一问题是，它主要是在美国东部和洛杉矶附近
Dialogue: 2,0:26:12.92,0:26:15.87,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}But if you are elsewhere, you may have never heard of ALDI and so if somebody clues this in the crossword.
Dialogue: 1,0:26:12.92,0:26:15.87,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但如果你住在其他地方，你可能从未听说过ALDI

Dialogue: 1,0:26:22.59,0:26:24.81,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以他们可能不会把这个词放进去
Dialogue: 2,0:26:24.81,0:26:30.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because it wouldn't be fair to people who don't live in an area where this grocery store exists, right?
Dialogue: 1,0:26:24.81,0:26:30.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为这对那些住在没有这个超市的地区的人来说不太公平，是吧？
Dialogue: 2,0:26:30.52,0:26:36.73,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}So, making sure that the word vocabulary is accessible to everybody is important.
Dialogue: 1,0:26:30.52,0:26:36.73,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此，要保证每个词对所有人来说都是可接触到的，这一点很重要

Dialogue: 1,0:44:04.86,0:44:09.47,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以对我来说，如果我从谜题作为一种媒介的审美价值来看待的话，

Dialogue: 2,0:44:35.96,0:44:44.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}But it's I think the sort of general vernacular about when people talk about puzzles they like they don't even have the words to describe this, right?
Dialogue: 1,0:44:35.96,0:44:44.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但我觉得一般人在谈论他们喜欢的谜题时，甚至都没有一个词来描述这一点，对吧？

Dialogue: 1,0:44:44.16,0:44:51.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}某个谜题在深度和意义层面上比另一个谜题更好这一点，对一些人来说很难理解或描述
Dialogue: 2,0:44:51.96,0:44:56.57,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}But the way I explain it is just how much truth is there in this puzzle.
Dialogue: 1,0:44:51.96,0:44:56.57,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而我解释的方式是，这个谜题中到底有多少真理和事实

Dialogue: 1,0:45:30.83,0:45:33.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这是因为他们在寻求某种特定的解谜体验
Dialogue: 2,0:45:33.64,0:45:40.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Some solvers just want that sort of low dose, low difficulty, repetition of the eureka moments they already know.

Dialogue: 1,0:46:00.84,0:46:08.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而有些谜题又有相反的美感，比如九连环实际上需要341步来解决
Dialogue: 2,0:46:08.52,0:46:14.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}It's basically 1024 divided by three, is how many steps it is.
Dialogue: 1,0:46:08.52,0:46:14.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}341大概是1024除以3，就是这么多的步骤
Dialogue: 2,0:46:14.16,0:46:20.30,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}And the process of going through and solving it is actually a very deep and meditative one
Dialogue: 1,0:46:14.16,0:46:20.30,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而解决它的过程实际上是一个非常深刻的沉思的过程

Dialogue: 1,0:46:25.23,0:46:30.86,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个过程跟尤里卡时刻就不太相关了
Dialogue: 2,0:46:30.86,0:46:34.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}I mean there is a deep eureka moment when you're discovering that this is actually what you have to do.
Dialogue: 1,0:46:30.86,0:46:34.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我的意思是，当你发现该这么解的那个时刻，确实有一个深刻的尤里卡时刻
Dialogue: 2,0:46:34.64,0:46:41.04,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}But the process of solving it is more a process, a meditative and slow process of methodically going through the motions.
Dialogue: 1,0:46:34.64,0:46:41.04,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但解的过程更像一个沉思的、缓慢的、有条不紊进行的过程

Dialogue: 2,0:46:48.14,0:46:53.96,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}And it's called the 205 minutes cube because if you're making one step per second, that's how long it takes you.
Dialogue: 1,0:46:48.14,0:46:53.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}它被称为"205分钟立方体"，是因为如果每秒走一步的话，那么这就是你总共需要的时间
Dialogue: 2,0:46:53.96,0:47:00.81,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}And the way it works is it has all these little blocks inside with pegs and you kind of have to like push and pull them out
Dialogue: 1,0:46:53.96,0:47:00.81,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}它的玩法是，它本身是由这些小的带有楔子的方块组成的，你得不断把它们取出插入
