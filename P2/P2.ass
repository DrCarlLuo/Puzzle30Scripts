Dialogue: 1,0:00:18.61,0:00:23.73,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the quintessential example of this is the puzzle Picross aka Nanograms
Dialogue: 0,0:00:18.61,0:00:23.73,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这方面最典型的例子是Picross，也就是"数织"游戏

Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.73,0:00:27.70,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}任天堂从90年代开始发行Picross游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:00:27.70,0:00:33.40,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and I think the first nanograms were published in the late 80s in various Japanese puzzle magazines.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.70,0:00:33.40,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而我认为第一个数织游戏是在80年代末发表在各种日本解谜杂志上的

Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.21,0:00:40.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}数织是由两个不同作者独立创造的
Dialogue: 1,0:00:40.56,0:00:45.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but alas one of the exciting things about nanograms is at the end you sort of get this picture
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.56,0:00:45.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}数织游戏令人兴奋的一点是，在最后你会得到这样的图案
Dialogue: 1,0:00:45.24,0:00:48.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and there's always this question like what is the picture gonna be,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.24,0:00:48.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}（在解的过程中）总会产生比如"这个图案会是什么呢？"的问题

Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.96,0:00:59.00,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个图案或图案代表的是什么呢？哦，是一只橡皮鸭！是一只狮子！最终终于被揭开了
Dialogue: 1,0:00:59.00,0:01:06.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Another example is this puzzle Spiral Galaxies which it doesn't have an ending surprise step at the end
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.00,0:01:06.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}另一个例子是"螺旋星系"谜题，它本身是没有一个惊喜的结尾的
Dialogue: 1,0:01:06.16,0:01:10.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but a variant of it does and I will show you the classic first
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.16,0:01:10.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但它的一个变体却有，我先给你们看经典版本
Dialogue: 1,0:01:10.84,0:01:12.88,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}So, this is the classic spiral galaxies.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.84,0:01:12.88,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这就是经典版本的螺旋星系
Dialogue: 1,0:01:12.88,0:01:16.02,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}The goal is to partition the grid into these regions,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.88,0:01:16.02,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}游戏目标是将网格划分为一些区域
Dialogue: 1,0:01:16.02,0:01:23.96,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}each of which contains exactly one dot and the shape of the region is rotationally symmetric 180 degrees around that dot.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.02,0:01:23.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}每个区域正好包含一个点，而且每个区域围绕那个点中心对称
Dialogue: 1,0:01:23.96,0:01:25.62,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}It's a very interesting puzzle.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.96,0:01:25.62,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这是一个非常有趣的谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:01:25.62,0:01:29.46,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}There's a lot of fascinating logic that goes into solving them.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:25.62,0:01:29.46,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}深入研究的话就会有很多迷人的逻辑
Dialogue: 1,0:01:29.46,0:01:35.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}But another similar type of puzzle which is printed by Nikoli under the name “Tentai Show”
Dialogue: 0,0:01:29.46,0:01:35.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}不过有一种类似的谜题，是Nikoli以"Tentai show"的名字刊发的
Dialogue: 1,0:01:35.80,0:01:38.48,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which is a hilarious pun if you know Japanese.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.80,0:01:38.48,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果你懂日语的话，（"Tentai Show"）这个名字还是个滑稽的双关
Dialogue: 1,0:01:38.48,0:01:42.77,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}“taishou” means symmetry and ten means symmetry about a point
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.48,0:01:42.77,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}「点」(ten)是点的意思，「対称」(taishou）是对称的意思，合起来就是点对称
Dialogue: 1,0:01:42.77,0:01:50.71,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but “tentai” also means sort of a heavenly body like a galaxy, so, this is a show of heavenly bodies.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.77,0:01:50.71,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但「天体」(tentai)又是天体的意思，所以，这又是"天体show"
Dialogue: 1,0:01:50.71,0:01:52.82,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Excellent pun.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:50.71,0:01:52.82,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}很棒的双关
Dialogue: 1,0:01:52.82,0:01:54.55,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Anyways digression
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.82,0:01:54.55,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}无论如何，有点跑题了
Dialogue: 1,0:01:54.55,0:01:59.86,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}this was first published in Nikoli magazine in 2001 by an author who goes by Gesaku
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.55,0:01:59.86,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个在2001年首次发表在Nikoli杂志上的作品，作者叫Gesaku
Dialogue: 1,0:01:59.86,0:02:04.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and it's essentially a spiral galaxy's puzzle where some of the dots are dark colored
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.86,0:02:04.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}它本质上还是一个螺旋星系谜题，不过其中一些点是涂黑了的
Dialogue: 1,0:02:04.08,0:02:07.54,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and if you shade the dark colored dots, you get a shape
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.08,0:02:07.54,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果你把黑点对应的区域上色的话，就会得到一个形状
Dialogue: 1,0:02:07.54,0:02:11.00,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and here's a more sophisticated example quite a large instance
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.54,0:02:11.00,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这里有一个更复杂的例子，相当大的一个例子
Dialogue: 1,0:02:11.00,0:02:16.37,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}when you solve it, you get this and the shape is that of an astronaut
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.00,0:02:16.37,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}当你解出来的时候，你会得到一个宇航员的图形
Dialogue: 1,0:02:16.37,0:02:20.34,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh quite an interesting uh composition that's been put together
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.37,0:02:20.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}非常有趣的构图
Dialogue: 1,0:02:20.34,0:02:23.09,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and you might ask well is the puzzle boring because of this
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.34,0:02:23.09,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你可能会问，这样做了之后谜题会不会变得无聊？
Dialogue: 1,0:02:23.09,0:02:29.81,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}does this sort of compromise the flow of the puzzle because you're having to make all of these regions fit together in exactly this way
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.09,0:02:29.81,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这是否会牺牲解谜过程，因为必须得让这些区域按图形这种方式组合在一起
Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.81,0:02:31.28,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the answer is mostly not
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.81,0:02:31.28,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}答案是大部分不会
Dialogue: 1,0:02:31.28,0:02:38.96,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like if you look over to the left side of this puzzle, you can kind of see there's really elaborate snaking and winding regions going all over the place
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.28,0:02:38.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果你看一下这个谜题的左边，你可以看到有一些精心设计的蜿蜒曲折的区域
Dialogue: 1,0:02:38.96,0:02:44.60,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and those are quite interesting to solve and to sort of figure out the logic of how that must be shaped
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.96,0:02:44.60,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这些解起来都很有趣，而且弄清楚形状形成的逻辑也很有趣
Dialogue: 1,0:02:44.60,0:02:52.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}however, putting those in sort of requires large amounts of just one color of region
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.60,0:02:52.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然而，把这些形状融入进去就会让很多区域是同一种颜色
Dialogue: 1,0:02:52.08,0:02:54.71,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and that can sort of force the design
Dialogue: 0,0:02:52.08,0:02:54.71,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这可能会影响到设计
Dialogue: 1,0:02:54.71,0:03:02.39,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}if you wanted to make a qr code into this then probably most of the puzzle would be relatively uninteresting to solve
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.71,0:03:02.39,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果你想弄成个二维码图案的谜题，那么谜题大部分解起来就会相对无趣了
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.39,0:03:07.96,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it relies or depends heavily on uh the shape being a certain way
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.39,0:03:07.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这在很大程度上依赖于形状本身
Dialogue: 1,0:03:07.96,0:03:10.20,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}here's an example that kind of illustrates that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.96,0:03:10.20,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这里有一个例子可以说明这一点
Dialogue: 1,0:03:10.20,0:03:15.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}this is you know I’m just putting this together to show off its GDC 2021
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.20,0:03:15.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个是我做的一个展现出GDC2021的图案

Dialogue: 0,0:03:20.69,0:03:23.89,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个就表面了你可以用任何图案来制作Tentai Show谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:03:23.89,0:03:28.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but like you know this is the 2 and it's just a diagonal set of one by one things
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.89,0:03:28.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但你看这是个2，它只是一个一个点斜着摆放而已
Dialogue: 1,0:03:28.44,0:03:34.13,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it's not particularly interesting or solve or fun to solve
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.44,0:03:34.13,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个解起来并不是特别有趣

Dialogue: 1,0:09:28.82,0:09:32.47,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, it's not A before B and it's not B before A
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.82,0:09:32.47,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，既不是先放A再放B，也不是先放B再放A
Dialogue: 1,0:09:32.47,0:09:34.20,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}well then it must be impossible, right

Dialogue: 1,0:09:34.20,0:09:39.70,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but no actually the solution is you take B and you put it in kind of halfway and you stick it up there
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.20,0:09:39.70,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但不是的，实际上解法是你把B放到一半，然后就先不动它
Dialogue: 1,0:09:39.70,0:09:43.73,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then you can kind of just put A in half way and slide it in the back
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.70,0:09:43.73,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后又把A放入到一半的位置，然后从后面把它塞进去
Dialogue: 1,0:09:43.73,0:09:47.38,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then b comes down
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.73,0:09:47.38,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后B就下来了
Dialogue: 1,0:09:47.38,0:09:53.33,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and there we go and then it's solved uh
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.38,0:09:53.33,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}就这样就解决了
Dialogue: 1,0:09:53.33,0:09:57.88,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, you know the trick is you have to put A in halfway
Dialogue: 0,0:09:53.33,0:09:57.88,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，诀窍是你必须把A放在一半的地方

Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.88,0:10:21.68,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}既不能先放A也不能先放B那显然就不可能了
Dialogue: 1,0:10:21.68,0:10:24.18,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but there was something that you didn't notice
Dialogue: 0,0:10:21.68,0:10:24.18,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但其实有些事情你没有注意到

Dialogue: 1,0:18:17.46,0:18:22.70,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the reason is because when you're doing a puzzle hunt puzzle these are typically puzzles where the rules are not provided
Dialogue: 0,0:18:17.46,0:18:22.70,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}原因是当你在做解谜寻宝时，这些谜题通常没有提供规则
Dialogue: 1,0:18:22.70,0:18:25.46,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and you have to figure out what it is that you need to do
Dialogue: 0,0:18:22.70,0:18:25.46,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你需要做的就是找出这些（规则）是什么
Dialogue: 1,0:18:25.46,0:18:27.70,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you might literally try anagraming everything
Dialogue: 0,0:18:25.46,0:18:27.70,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你可能会试着把所有词的异构词都尝试一遍
Dialogue: 1,0:18:27.70,0:18:32.11,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you could dump every word in this puzzle the title of every puzzle whatever into anagram generators
Dialogue: 0,0:18:27.70,0:18:32.11,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你可能会把谜题中的每个词、每个谜题的标题都放到异构词生成器中
Dialogue: 1,0:18:32.11,0:18:37.81,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and just come up with nothing or come up with something that's maybe tenuously there but turns out to be nothing
Dialogue: 0,0:18:32.11,0:18:37.81,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后什么都没有得到
Dialogue: 1,0:18:37.81,0:18:41.97,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and that experience as a solver is not a pleasant experience
Dialogue: 0,0:18:37.81,0:18:41.97,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}作为一个解题者，这种体验并不愉快
Dialogue: 1,0:18:41.97,0:18:44.78,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, to you know save the solver from having to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:18:41.97,0:18:44.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，为了让解谜者不去做这种事情
Dialogue: 1,0:18:44.78,0:18:51.31,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}the uh the authors of puzzle hunt puzzles will just tell you right up front there are no unclued anagrams in this puzzle hunt
Dialogue: 0,0:18:44.78,0:18:51.31,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}解谜寻宝的作者会直接告诉你，这里面没有那种没提供线索的同字母异构词
Dialogue: 1,0:18:51.31,0:18:55.02,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and that will be part of the rules that are communicated to the player um
Dialogue: 0,0:18:51.31,0:18:55.02,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而这也是传达给玩家的规则的一部分
Dialogue: 1,0:18:55.02,0:18:59.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Cryptic Crosswords have a similar convention where they don't do indirect anagrams
Dialogue: 0,0:18:55.02,0:18:59.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Cryptic Crossword也有类似的惯例，它们不会有不直接的异构词
Dialogue: 1,0:18:59.44,0:19:05.01,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which is basically like uh you know if there's an anagram it has to be clued by a trigger word
Dialogue: 0,0:18:59.44,0:19:05.01,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}基本上就是说，如果里面有一个异构词，那么它就必须由一个触发词来提示
Dialogue: 1,0:19:05.01,0:19:08.66,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and it can't be mixed with another type of hint
Dialogue: 0,0:19:05.01,0:19:08.66,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而且不能和其他类型的线索混在一起
Dialogue: 1,0:19:08.66,0:19:11.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}escape rooms have some conventions like “one key one lock “
Dialogue: 0,0:19:08.66,0:19:11.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}密室逃脱也有一些惯例，比如“一个钥匙对应一把锁”
Dialogue: 1,0:19:11.92,0:19:17.10,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}if you get a four-digit code, you're never gonna have to put it in multiple different four-digit combination locks
Dialogue: 0,0:19:11.92,0:19:17.10,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果你得到了一个四位的密码，那你永远也不需要在多个密码锁上输入它
Dialogue: 1,0:19:17.10,0:19:19.09,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because again that would just be irritating
Dialogue: 0,0:19:17.10,0:19:19.09,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为那也会让人很不爽
Dialogue: 1,0:19:19.09,0:19:22.35,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}are you do you want the player to have to retry everything over and over again no
Dialogue: 0,0:19:19.09,0:19:22.35,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你想让玩家一次又一次地重试之前所有的东西吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:19:22.35,0:19:26.90,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, one key one lock is sort of a convention that saves the sanity of some players
Dialogue: 0,0:19:22.35,0:19:26.90,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，“一个钥匙对应一把锁”是一种惯例，可以拯救玩家的San值
Dialogue: 1,0:19:26.90,0:19:30.42,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}now whether or not this is advertised or told to the players before they begin
Dialogue: 0,0:19:26.90,0:19:30.42,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}至于是否在宣传的时候或者在玩之间就告诉玩家
Dialogue: 1,0:19:30.42,0:19:34.77,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it's you know it's kind of 50-50. it depends on which escape room you're doing
Dialogue: 0,0:19:30.42,0:19:34.77,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}可能五五开吧，这取决于你玩的哪家密室逃脱
Dialogue: 1,0:19:34.77,0:19:37.71,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh no outside knowledge is another common convention
Dialogue: 0,0:19:34.77,0:19:37.71,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}不依赖外界信息也是另一个常见的惯例
Dialogue: 1,0:19:37.71,0:19:42.00,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but it's sort of like if you're a solver of Cryptics
Dialogue: 0,0:19:37.71,0:19:42.00,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然而，如果你是一个比如说Cryptic Crossword的老手，
Dialogue: 1,0:19:42.00,0:19:44.82,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you probably realize this no indirect anagrams rule
Dialogue: 0,0:19:42.00,0:19:44.82,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你可能会意识到无不直接的异构词这个规则
Dialogue: 1,0:19:44.82,0:19:47.70,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}even if it's just subconsciously because you just never see it right
Dialogue: 0,0:19:44.82,0:19:47.70,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}即便这只是潜意识的，因为你从来没有见过它出现
Dialogue: 1,0:19:47.70,0:19:50.77,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you just realize that oh well they wouldn't print that I don't have to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:19:47.70,0:19:50.77,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你只是意识到，他们不会出这种谜题，我不需要这么做
Dialogue: 1,0:19:50.77,0:19:57.30,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but beginners may not understand this and may never even really have learned it unless somebody taught them
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.77,0:19:57.30,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但新手可能不明白这一点，除非有人教他们否则他们没办法知道
Dialogue: 1,0:19:57.30,0:20:02.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, beginners can spend a lot of time on cryptics just trying stuff that is never possibly necessary
Dialogue: 0,0:19:57.30,0:20:02.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以新手可能会花很多时间在谜题上去尝试一些根本没必要的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:20:02.16,0:20:05.04,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because they don't understand the conventions of the genre right
Dialogue: 0,0:20:02.16,0:20:05.04,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为他们不了解这类谜题的惯例
Dialogue: 1,0:20:05.04,0:20:06.58,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so square dealing is important
Dialogue: 0,0:20:05.04,0:20:06.58,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以Square Dealing很重要
Dialogue: 1,0:20:06.58,0:20:11.12,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}But in video games especially it's also important to communicate those rules to the player
Dialogue: 0,0:20:06.58,0:20:11.12,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但在电子游戏中，向玩家传达这些规则也很重要
Dialogue: 1,0:20:11.12,0:20:16.94,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because every puzzle game you play will have different rules about how the puzzles are designed and what's allowed and what's not
Dialogue: 0,0:20:11.12,0:20:16.94,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为每个解谜游戏关于怎么设计的、什么能做什么不能做的规则都是不同的
Dialogue: 1,0:20:16.94,0:20:19.95,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and sometimes it's not that explicit
Dialogue: 0,0:20:16.94,0:20:19.95,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而且有时并不那么明确
Dialogue: 1,0:20:19.95,0:20:22.13,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}some games actually tell the player
Dialogue: 0,0:20:19.95,0:20:22.13,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而有些游戏实际上会直接告诉玩家
Dialogue: 1,0:20:22.13,0:20:24.75,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and this is a game called Ittle Dew which is sort of a Zelda-like
Dialogue: 0,0:20:22.13,0:20:24.75,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这是一个叫《Ittle Dew》的游戏，是一个类塞尔达的游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:20:24.75,0:20:30.38,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and after you exit the first dungeon it literally tells you there's no missable items or chests in dungeons at all
Dialogue: 0,0:20:24.75,0:20:30.38,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}在你离开第一个地牢后，它会直接告诉你，已经没有可错过的物品或箱子了
Dialogue: 1,0:20:30.38,0:20:34.48,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and not every Zelda-like has these types of conventions
Dialogue: 0,0:20:30.38,0:20:34.48,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而并非每个类塞尔达游戏都有这种惯例
Dialogue: 1,0:20:34.48,0:20:39.79,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and in classic Zelda’s usually the convention is there's no need to return to dungeons later
Dialogue: 0,0:20:34.48,0:20:39.79,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而在经典塞尔达中，通常的惯例是之后就不用回到之前的地牢了
Dialogue: 1,0:20:39.79,0:20:50.48,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}meaning that every item that you could get in a dungeon is one that you could get with sort of the key or progression items from that dungeon and earlier or and the prerequisites
Dialogue: 0,0:20:39.79,0:20:50.48,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}意味着在地牢里得到的每件物品都是可以通过钥匙或者进展物品而得到的
Dialogue: 1,0:20:50.48,0:20:56.11,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}although that's not true in every Zelda and it's not true in uh every dungeon of every Zelda
Dialogue: 0,0:20:50.48,0:20:56.11,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}虽然不是每一部塞尔达都是如此，而不是每个地牢都是如此
Dialogue: 1,0:20:56.11,0:21:02.13,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, um having that type of square dealing is useful
Dialogue: 0,0:20:56.11,0:21:02.13,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，有这种类似“Square Dealing”的原则是有用的
Dialogue: 1,0:21:02.13,0:21:10.26,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and communicating it to the player can really help build that trusting relationship that allows the player to sort of press on when they're stuck on a puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:21:02.13,0:21:10.26,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}将其传达给玩家可以帮助建立信任关系，让玩家在被卡住的时候可以继续前进
Dialogue: 1,0:21:10.26,0:21:14.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}the sort of contrapositive to that is avoid cheap tricks
Dialogue: 0,0:21:10.26,0:21:14.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而与之对应的则是“避免使用拙劣的把戏”

Dialogue: 0,0:21:21.20,0:21:27.22,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这不是游戏里的主线谜题，是要拿星星的支线谜题

Dialogue: 0,0:22:13.74,0:22:18.35,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}取而代之的是这样的想法：“这个会不会又是像树上的反光镜那样的***呢？”
Dialogue: 1,0:22:18.35,0:22:23.54,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um it turns out that after the game launched they actually patched it
Dialogue: 0,0:22:18.35,0:22:23.54,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}不过游戏发售之后，他们把这个改了
Dialogue: 1,0:22:23.54,0:22:30.58,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and they changed that reflector in the tree to a reflector on a very prominent salient pillar that you could see from all directions
Dialogue: 0,0:22:23.54,0:22:30.58,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}他们把树上的反射器改成了放在一个非常显眼的柱子上，从各个方向都看得到

Dialogue: 0,0:22:30.58,0:22:32.88,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这样一来就很清楚上面有一个反射器
Dialogue: 1,0:22:32.88,0:22:38.90,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then it became a mystery of what's that reflector on the pillar for, turns out one of the secret bonus stars
Dialogue: 0,0:22:32.88,0:22:38.90,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后就成了一个谜题：那根柱子上的反射器是干什么的？原来是为了一颗星星
Dialogue: 1,0:22:38.90,0:22:42.03,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and this is sort of a much more honest way of designing this puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:22:38.90,0:22:42.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这种设计谜题的方式就更加诚实得多

Dialogue: 1,0:34:56.75,0:35:01.04,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, you kind of have to do a spin move to get the two balls to the opposite side to push it down
Dialogue: 0,0:34:56.75,0:35:01.04,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以你做一个旋转动作，让两个球跑到两端去，然后把它推下去

Dialogue: 0,0:40:57.78,0:41:01.42,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也就是说，每个字母都同时存在于横排和竖排的单词中

Dialogue: 0,0:41:30.61,0:41:37.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而这个确认物是一种推动力，让你继续前进，让你明白方向是正确的
Dialogue: 1,0:41:37.78,0:41:42.06,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um Cryptics actually do this within individual clues
Dialogue: 0,0:41:37.78,0:41:42.06,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Cryptic填字游戏在每一个谜面中都是这样做的
Dialogue: 1,0:41:42.06,0:41:51.98,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, uh in crypted crosswords if you don't know every clue actually contains both a literal definition and a sort of pun or cryptic definition
Dialogue: 0,0:41:42.06,0:41:51.98,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}在Cryptic填字游戏中每条谜面都包含了一个字面解释和一个类似双关或字谜的解释
Dialogue: 1,0:41:51.98,0:41:56.34,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, you might see a seven letter word for terrain scrambled coach
Dialogue: 0,0:41:51.98,0:41:56.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以你会看到这样一个对应7个字母单词的谜题“Terrain Scrambled Coach”

Dialogue: 0,0:41:56.34,0:41:59.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你把它从中间分开，Coach就是Trainer（教练）
Dialogue: 1,0:41:59.34,0:42:04.53,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but the word terrain scrambled i.e. anagrams is also the word trainer
Dialogue: 0,0:41:59.34,0:42:04.53,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而“Terrain Scrambled”（把Terrain打乱），\N 也就是说Terrain的同字母异构词，也是Trainer
Dialogue: 1,0:42:04.53,0:42:11.12,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, within every individual clue, you have a confirmer because you have two sides of it that make the answer

Dialogue: 1,1:02:01.53,1:02:11.07,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it's the “cast H&H” they're these two h-shaped pieces which can kind of be stuck together and roll around one another in these interesting 3d way ways
Dialogue: 0,1:02:01.53,1:02:11.07,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个谜题叫《Cast H&H》，这两块H型部分可以拼在一起，绕着对方以有趣的三维方式转动
Dialogue: 1,1:02:11.07,1:02:15.55,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}the goal is to separate the two pieces but to do this requires a huge number of moves
Dialogue: 0,1:02:11.07,1:02:15.55,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}目标是把这两部分分开，但要做到这一点需要大量的操作

Dialogue: 1,1:02:19.64,1:02:24.19,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}these are sort of all the different configurations that these two pieces can be in
Dialogue: 0,1:02:19.64,1:02:24.19,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这些是这两部分能够出现的所有不同结构
Dialogue: 1,1:02:24.19,1:02:28.03,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the lines represent possible transitions from those states
Dialogue: 0,1:02:24.19,1:02:28.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而连线代表状态之间可能的转移
Dialogue: 1,1:02:28.03,1:02:33.53,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, wherever there is a line it means you can get the two puzzle pieces from that one state to the other one
Dialogue: 0,1:02:28.03,1:02:33.53,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，只要有一条线，就意味着你可以把这两部分从一个状态移到另一个状态上
Dialogue: 1,1:02:33.53,1:02:44.41,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and when there isn't a line it means that somehow that transition has been blocked either by a little nubby of the puzzle a little piece of metal that kind of just prevents you from uh making that transition
Dialogue: 0,1:02:33.53,1:02:44.41,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而没有连线的话，就意味着这个转移被阻挡了，可能是被玩具上一个小疙瘩或一块金属挡住了
Dialogue: 1,1:02:44.41,1:02:53.31,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and therefore finding a solution to this puzzle is equivalent to finding a path through this graph from in to out along these edges
Dialogue: 0,1:02:44.41,1:02:53.31,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此，找到这个谜题的答案就相当于找到一条在图中从IN到OUT的一条路径

Dialogue: 0,1:03:27.93,1:03:34.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}其中每个结点是谜题的一个单独的状态，每条边是这两个状态之间的转移
Dialogue: 1,1:03:34.14,1:03:42.65,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and a state in this case consists of a location of where the boxes are and a connected region where the player is
Dialogue: 0,1:03:34.14,1:03:42.65,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这种情况下，一个状态是由箱子的位置以及玩家能走的连通区域组成
Dialogue: 1,1:03:42.65,1:03:47.32,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so individual moves are not considered state changes unless they push a box
Dialogue: 0,1:03:42.65,1:03:47.32,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此，玩家单独的移动不会被看做状态变换，除非推动了箱子

Dialogue: 1,1:04:01.40,1:04:09.34,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the coloring here is based on players trying to attempt to solve this puzzle and how much time they spent in each state of the puzzle
Dialogue: 0,1:04:01.40,1:04:09.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这里的颜色是根据玩家尝试解决这个谜题的情况，以及他们在每个状态下花费的时间

Dialogue: 0,1:04:12.22,1:04:16.06,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你可以看到，在通过瓶颈之前他们花了很多时间
Dialogue: 1,1:04:16.06,1:04:18.75,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and once they get through there's hardly any time spent at all

Dialogue: 0,1:04:21.63,1:04:28.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，理解并操作状态图可以让你控制谜题的各个方面

Dialogue: 0,1:04:28.80,1:04:32.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}显然，状态空间越大，谜题就越困难，可能的状态越多
Dialogue: 1,1:04:32.44,1:04:34.49,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but the bottlenecks are what create difficulty
Dialogue: 0,1:04:32.44,1:04:34.49,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但瓶颈是造成困难的原因
Dialogue: 1,1:04:34.49,1:04:38.65,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and if you have multiple bottlenecks that can make things even more difficult

Dialogue: 1,1:06:56.89,1:07:03.29,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the way in which the solver goes from the initial puzzle to the solution is very different for these two puzzles
Dialogue: 0,1:06:56.89,1:07:03.29,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}对于这两个谜题，解谜者从最初的起点到最终解的方式是非常不同的
Dialogue: 1,1:07:03.29,1:07:06.04,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}on the bottom one there's kind of two places you can make progress
Dialogue: 0,1:07:03.29,1:07:06.04,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}在下面这个谜题中，有两个地方你可以作为起点来取得进展
Dialogue: 1,1:07:06.04,1:07:10.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and you sort of linearly do the bottom half the loop and the top half of the loop and they meet together
Dialogue: 0,1:07:06.04,1:07:10.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你可以类似线性地完成下半部分和上半部分的环，然后它们会汇合在一起
Dialogue: 1,1:07:10.14,1:07:14.43,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}whereas this top one you can start just about anywhere on any corner of the grid
Dialogue: 0,1:07:10.14,1:07:14.43,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而上面这个你可以从网格的任何地方开始
Dialogue: 1,1:07:14.43,1:07:19.29,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then you kind of get about this much before you then have to uh solve some more
Dialogue: 0,1:07:14.43,1:07:19.29,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后你就只能解出来一点，然后就得（从其他地方开始）进一步解决

Dialogue: 0,1:07:19.29,1:07:22.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这里这个是一个更大的人工构建的数回的例子
Dialogue: 1,1:07:22.17,1:07:26.33,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}where there's sort of like three different places where you can make progress linearly
Dialogue: 0,1:07:22.17,1:07:26.33,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}里面有三个不同的地方，你可以作为起点来线性地取得进展
Dialogue: 1,1:07:26.33,1:07:31.20,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then in the middle uh they all come together and make the final solution to the puzzle
Dialogue: 0,1:07:26.33,1:07:31.20,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后再中间它们都交汇到一起，称为谜题的最终解
Dialogue: 1,1:07:31.20,1:07:37.60,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, as a solver you can start in a couple of these different corners and make progress
Dialogue: 0,1:07:31.20,1:07:37.60,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以作为一个解谜者，你可以从这些不同的角落开始并取得进展
Dialogue: 1,1:07:37.60,1:07:42.01,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but when you're going along each section there's this sort of smooth flow of
Dialogue: 0,1:07:37.60,1:07:42.01,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而你在每个部分进行下去的时候，会有一种丝滑的思维流
Dialogue: 1,1:07:42.01,1:07:46.11,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}oh i did this oh now i get this oh now i get this oh now i get this

Dialogue: 1,1:07:46.11,1:07:51.61,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and it feels very um exciting as a solver to feel that you're on the right track
Dialogue: 0,1:07:46.11,1:07:51.61,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}作为一个解谜者，你会对感觉自己在正确的轨道上感到非常兴奋
Dialogue: 1,1:07:51.61,1:07:57.63,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and for every bit of progress to then unlock further progress it sort of makes that progress feel even better
Dialogue: 0,1:07:51.61,1:07:57.63,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而每取得一点进展就能解锁更多进展，这让取得进展的感觉更好
Dialogue: 1,1:07:57.63,1:08:06.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because in addition to solving part of the grid you're also allowing yourself to solve another part of the grid, so it's it's very exciting
Dialogue: 0,1:07:57.63,1:08:06.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为在解决这部分网格之外，你相当于当自己解决另一部分，因此这是很令人兴奋的
Dialogue: 1,1:08:06.14,1:08:11.39,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}the linear solution path can be much harder especially for a large puzzle
Dialogue: 0,1:08:06.14,1:08:11.39,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}线性的解谜路径可能会难得多，尤其是对于很大的谜题来说
Dialogue: 1,1:08:11.39,1:08:14.20,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because you may not know where to start if you have a big grid
Dialogue: 0,1:08:11.39,1:08:14.20,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为如果你有一个很大的网格的话，你可能不知道从哪里开始
Dialogue: 1,1:08:14.20,1:08:18.36,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and there's literally only one place where you can make progress then that can take a lot of time to find um
Dialogue: 0,1:08:14.20,1:08:18.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而实际上你又只有一个地方可以开始取得进展，那么就需要花费大量的时间去寻找
Dialogue: 1,1:08:18.36,1:08:22.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}whereas if you have a bushy solution path then the solver is less likely to be stuck
Dialogue: 0,1:08:18.36,1:08:22.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而对应的，如果你的解题路径很“枝繁叶茂”、很丰富，那么解谜者就不太可能被卡住
Dialogue: 1,1:08:22.14,1:08:27.39,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and can sort of proceed from more areas and feel like they're making progress sooner
Dialogue: 0,1:08:22.14,1:08:27.39,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而且可以从更多的地方取得进展，感觉他们更快地取得了进展
Dialogue: 1,1:08:27.39,1:08:32.51,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but yeah the linear solution pass can lead to sort of these interesting solution flows
Dialogue: 0,1:08:27.39,1:08:32.51,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但是，线性的解谜路径能够产生这种有趣的解谜思维流
Dialogue: 1,1:08:32.51,1:08:36.09,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}that can be more of a work of art and can be more exciting um
Dialogue: 0,1:08:32.51,1:08:36.09,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这会更有艺术性、更令人兴奋
Dialogue: 1,1:08:36.09,1:08:46.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's see so uh yeah this this is an idea that um we use internally working on our new game
Dialogue: 0,1:08:36.09,1:08:46.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}下面这个是我们在开发新游戏时我们团队内部的一个想法
Dialogue: 1,1:08:46.52,1:08:49.79,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which is how big is the puzzle grid versus how difficult it is
Dialogue: 0,1:08:46.52,1:08:49.79,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那就是 谜题规模大小 vs 谜题难度
Dialogue: 1,1:08:49.79,1:08:52.48,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh you know if it has few steps and it's trivially difficult
Dialogue: 0,1:08:49.79,1:08:52.48,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果一个谜题只需要几个步骤，而难度又不大
Dialogue: 1,1:08:52.48,1:08:55.74,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}then it's you know it's whatever it's boring it's a tutorial puzzle it's nothing
Dialogue: 0,1:08:52.48,1:08:55.74,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那么它就会很无聊，可能是个教程谜题，或者啥也不是
Dialogue: 1,1:08:55.74,1:08:57.85,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but the two types that are interesting are
Dialogue: 0,1:08:55.74,1:08:57.85,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但有两种类型会有趣，其中一个是
Dialogue: 1,1:08:57.85,1:09:00.54,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}if you have many steps of low difficulty we call this a flow puzzle
Dialogue: 0,1:08:57.85,1:09:00.54,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果谜题有很多步骤，但难度不大，我们称之为“流”型谜题
Dialogue: 1,1:09:00.54,1:09:05.02,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}versus you have few steps but high difficulty maybe only one difficult step
Dialogue: 0,1:09:00.54,1:09:05.02,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而如果你的步骤不多，但难度很高，也许只有一个困难的步骤
Dialogue: 1,1:09:05.02,1:09:09.50,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and sort of the whole puzzle is about figuring out that one difficult interesting thing
Dialogue: 0,1:09:05.02,1:09:09.50,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而整个谜题就是要找出那一个困难的有趣的东西
Dialogue: 1,1:09:09.50,1:09:11.48,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we call that a gem puzzle
Dialogue: 0,1:09:09.50,1:09:11.48,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们称之为“精华”型谜题
Dialogue: 1,1:09:11.48,1:09:14.62,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and of course if you have many steps in high difficulty then it's just a slog
Dialogue: 0,1:09:11.48,1:09:14.62,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}当然，如果步骤又多难度又大，那它就单纯是艰苦而漫长的谜题
Dialogue: 1,1:09:14.62,1:09:16.73,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it's going to be you know it's going to take a long time

Dialogue: 0,1:09:16.73,1:09:19.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}需要投入很多时间进去
Dialogue: 1,1:09:19.16,1:09:23.71,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but the flowy puzzles and the gems are usually the most suitable for video games
Dialogue: 0,1:09:19.16,1:09:23.71,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但“流”型谜题和“精华”型谜题通常是最适合电子游戏的
Dialogue: 1,1:09:23.71,1:09:26.72,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and for us they've been the most interesting
