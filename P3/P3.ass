Dialogue: 1,0:00:03.45,0:00:11.00,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um here we're gonna get into some real nitty-gritty puzzle construction and design stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.45,0:00:11.00,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}在这一部分，我们将探讨一些关于谜题构造与设计的一些真正重要的细节
Dialogue: 1,0:00:11.00,0:00:16.12,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um so you know this is the meat of the talk really um
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.00,0:00:16.12,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你懂的，这部分才真正是这次讲座的重点
Dialogue: 1,0:00:16.12,0:00:20.03,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}lesson number 21 is “speak playfully to the solver”
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.12,0:00:20.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}第21课是 「与解题者愉快地交谈」
Dialogue: 2,0:00:20.03,0:00:25.02,Annote,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}（译者注：Akari Puzzle，中文叫《点灯游戏》、《点亮游戏》、《数灯》，由Nikoli于2001年首次发布）
Dialogue: 1,0:00:20.03,0:00:25.02,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and uh to illustrate this I want to show you an akari puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.03,0:00:25.02,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}为了说明这一点，我想给你们看一个《点灯游戏》（Akari Puzzle）
Dialogue: 1,0:00:25.02,0:00:28.54,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}akari is a puzzle type where you're given a grid it's a logic puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.02,0:00:28.54,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}点灯游戏是一种逻辑解谜，里面会给你一个网格
Dialogue: 1,0:00:28.54,0:00:32.57,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and there's some cells that have different numbers in them
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.54,0:00:32.57,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有些格子里会有不同的数字
Dialogue: 1,0:00:32.57,0:00:37.50,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the goal is to place light bulbs in the grid in some of the empty cells
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.57,0:00:37.50,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}目标是在一些空格子里放上灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:00:37.50,0:00:39.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and there are three rules
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.50,0:00:39.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有三条规则
Dialogue: 1,0:00:39.80,0:00:49.34,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}one is that the lights shine horizontally and vertically and your goal is to cover the whole grid to illuminate the whole grid using lights
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.80,0:00:49.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}第一条，灯泡会水平和垂直地照亮一行和一列，而你的目标是用灯光照亮整个网格
Dialogue: 1,0:00:49.34,0:00:51.77,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}however there are two constraints
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.34,0:00:51.77,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但是有两个限制
Dialogue: 1,0:00:51.77,0:00:56.00,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}one is two lights are not allowed to illuminate each other
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.77,0:00:56.00,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}一是两盏灯不允许互相照亮到对方
Dialogue: 1,0:00:56.00,0:01:04.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the second is the numbers on the grid tell you the the number of lights adjacent to that number in the sort of north south east west directions
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.00,0:01:04.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}二是，网格上的数字告诉你该格子上下左右相邻的灯泡数量
Dialogue: 1,0:01:04.44,0:01:10.01,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, a two for example like this one has two lights next to it here and here
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.44,0:01:10.01,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如说，这个数字2，旁边有两盏灯，这里和这里
Dialogue: 1,0:01:10.01,0:01:14.36,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and this one has one light next to it there and so on that's it
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.01,0:01:14.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个1旁边就有一盏灯，就是这样
Dialogue: 1,0:01:14.36,0:01:18.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um so I want to show you the solution to this puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.36,0:01:18.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我想给你们展示下这个谜题的解答过程
Dialogue: 1,0:01:18.14,0:01:21.34,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh and we will observe some remarkable things
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.14,0:01:21.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们将观察到一些了不起的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:01:21.34,0:01:27.42,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um so this is a site called puzzlink where you can play a lot of these types of logic puzzles
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.34,0:01:27.42,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这谁一个叫做puzz.link的网站，里面你可以玩到很多这种类型的逻辑谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:01:27.42,0:01:30.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and we'll take you through the solution
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.42,0:01:30.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我将带你过一遍解答过程
Dialogue: 1,0:01:30.24,0:01:32.73,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}at first actually this is this is a somewhat difficult puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.24,0:01:32.73,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}首先，这是个有点难度的谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:01:32.73,0:01:35.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}this is not necessarily a completely beginner level puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.73,0:01:35.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这并不是一个初级的谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:01:35.16,0:01:40.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}at first you may not find any immediate location to make progress
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.16,0:01:40.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}一开始你可能找不到任何一个直接看得出来的位置来取得进展
Dialogue: 1,0:01:40.80,0:01:43.55,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but one thing to look at is this one in the corner
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.80,0:01:43.55,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但值得注意的是这个角落里的1
Dialogue: 1,0:01:43.55,0:01:48.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, we know that there's either a light bulb here or here
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.55,0:01:48.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们知道要么有个灯泡在这里，要么在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:01:48.80,0:01:51.42,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but we don't know which of those two it is yet
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.80,0:01:51.42,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但我们还不能确定是其中哪一个
Dialogue: 1,0:01:51.42,0:01:55.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}however, one thing we can deduce is that there cannot be a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.42,0:01:55.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然而，我们可以推出的是，这里是不可能有灯泡的
Dialogue: 1,0:01:55.84,0:02:02.36,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because if there was a light bulb here then both this cell and that cell will be ruled out from having a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.84,0:02:02.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为如果这里有一个灯泡，那么这个还有那个格子都不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:02.36,0:02:04.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because two light bulbs cannot illuminate each other
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.36,0:02:04.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为两个灯泡不能互相照亮对方
Dialogue: 1,0:02:04.80,0:02:08.32,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um therefore there can't be a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.80,0:02:08.32,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此这里不可能有一个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:08.32,0:02:12.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, using a dot we can mark this cell as a cell that doesn't have a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.32,0:02:12.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以我们用一个小点来代表这里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:12.92,0:02:17.72,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}another way of seeing this is that if there was a light bulb there or a light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.92,0:02:17.72,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}从另一个角度来看这个问题，如果这里有个灯泡，或那里有个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:17.72,0:02:21.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}in both cases this cell is ruled out from containing a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.72,0:02:21.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}在这两种情况下，这个格子都被排除在外
Dialogue: 1,0:02:21.56,0:02:24.38,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}therefore in both cases there's no light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.56,0:02:24.38,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此，在这两种情况下，这里都不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:24.38,0:02:29.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we can make similar progress by looking at this two here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.38,0:02:29.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以用类似的方法来看这个2
Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.24,0:02:33.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}there's sort of three candidate locations where a light bulb could be
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.24,0:02:33.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这里有三个候选位置来放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:33.08,0:02:36.03,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but only two of them will contain light bulbs
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.08,0:02:36.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但其中只有两个会放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:36.03,0:02:40.19,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}however we can deduce that this cell right here cannot contain a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.03,0:02:40.19,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然而，我们可以推断出，这一格不可能包含灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:40.19,0:02:47.10,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}otherwise there would only be one other space left adjacent to this too because these two cells would both be ruled out
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.19,0:02:47.10,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}否则这个2旁边就只剩一个能放灯泡的格子了，因为这两格都被覆盖了
Dialogue: 1,0:02:47.10,0:02:50.11,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}therefore there cannot be a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.10,0:02:50.11,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此这里不可能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:50.11,0:02:56.76,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, knowing that these two cells cannot be light bulbs allows us to make additional progress
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.11,0:02:56.76,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，知道这两格不能放灯泡让我们有了更多的进展
Dialogue: 1,0:02:56.76,0:03:02.97,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}if we look at this two right down here we may also deduce that this cell can't be a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.76,0:03:02.97,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果我们看一下下面这个2，我们也能推断出这一格不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.97,0:03:07.45,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because again it would rule out two possible locations of the three that could be light bulbs
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.97,0:03:07.45,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为它也把三个格子中的两个位置给覆盖掉了
Dialogue: 1,0:03:07.45,0:03:09.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}therefore there's no light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.45,0:03:09.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此那里不能放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:09.24,0:03:16.35,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}similarly there's no light bulb here because it would rule out those two cells leaving only one place remaining for another light bulb adjacent to this two
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.24,0:03:16.35,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}同样地，这里也不能有灯泡，因为它将覆盖掉这两格，只剩下一个与这个2相邻的位置了
Dialogue: 1,0:03:16.35,0:03:18.27,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so there's no light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.35,0:03:18.27,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以这里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:18.27,0:03:22.30,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and now we can look at this one and do similar logic
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.27,0:03:22.30,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在我们可以看这个1，做类似的逻辑
Dialogue: 1,0:03:22.30,0:03:26.72,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}there can't be a light bulb here because it would rule out both of these, therefore that's not a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.30,0:03:26.72,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这里不能有灯泡，因为它将覆盖这两格，所以不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:26.72,0:03:34.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and that chains into the next two and now we can't have a light bulb here or here because they would both rule out too many locations
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.72,0:03:34.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后逻辑链走到下个2，这里或这里都不能有灯泡，因为它们覆盖掉了太多位置
Dialogue: 1,0:03:34.14,0:03:39.39,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and using the same type of chaining logic we could see on this two there can't be light bulbs here and there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.14,0:03:39.39,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}用同样的逻辑链，我们可以看到，对于这个2，这里和这里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:39.39,0:03:42.78,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then this dot implies that for this one there can't be a light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.39,0:03:42.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后这个点表明，对于这个1，那里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:42.78,0:03:46.75,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then this two is then implied that there are no light bulbs here or here
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.78,0:03:46.75,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后这个2，这里和这里也不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.75,0:03:50.78,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and now on this one we can learn that there's no light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.75,0:03:50.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后对这个1，我们知道这里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.78,0:03:57.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and on this one we can learn that there's no light bulb here because again it would rule out all the possible locations where a light bulb could be
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.78,0:03:57.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后对于这个1，我们知道这里不能有灯泡，因为一样的，它会覆盖所有可选位置

Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.82,0:08:56.89,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但这里，我就直接即兴创作了
Dialogue: 1,0:08:56.89,0:09:00.22,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, we're creating an Akari puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.89,0:09:00.22,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那么，我们是要创作一个点灯游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:09:00.22,0:09:04.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's make a low difficulty one and insert lots of easy steps
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.22,0:09:04.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们做一个低难度的，插入些简单的步骤
Dialogue: 1,0:09:04.44,0:09:07.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}something we might do is let's put in a zero
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.44,0:09:07.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们能做的是，我们先放个0进去
Dialogue: 1,0:09:07.84,0:09:10.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}a zero is sort of an obvious place to get started
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.84,0:09:10.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}0是一个很明显的可以作为起点的地方
Dialogue: 1,0:09:10.52,0:09:15.32,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it's a so-called “hook” it's a thing that the player will immediately take their pencil and put in something
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.52,0:09:15.32,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这就是一个所谓的引子，是一个能让玩家立即拿起笔填上的东西
Dialogue: 1,0:09:15.32,0:09:17.88,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and let me just zoom out a tick
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.32,0:09:17.88,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我缩小一点
Dialogue: 1,0:09:17.88,0:09:23.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}the method that we're using here is we're gonna place clues and solve the puzzle at the same time
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.88,0:09:23.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们这里要使用的方法是，我们放置线索的同时进行解谜的过程
Dialogue: 1,0:09:23.64,0:09:28.70,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and we're going to place clues in the order that the player would sort of notice them as they were solving the puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.64,0:09:28.70,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们要按照玩家在解谜时注意到的顺序来放置线索
Dialogue: 1,0:09:28.70,0:09:30.36,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, we flip into answer mode
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.70,0:09:30.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，我们切换到解题模式
Dialogue: 1,0:09:30.36,0:09:39.00,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then in answer mode we'll mark these two cells as cells that uh the solver will know are not light bulbs
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.36,0:09:39.00,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后在解题模式中，我们将这两个格子标记为不能放置灯泡的地方
Dialogue: 1,0:09:39.00,0:09:42.65,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we'll go back into edit mode and let's just add some more stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.00,0:09:42.65,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后我们回到编辑模式，再增加一些内容
Dialogue: 1,0:09:42.65,0:09:46.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um you know let's try putting a two here right
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.65,0:09:46.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们试着在这里放个2
Dialogue: 1,0:09:46.17,0:09:47.45,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we'll go into answer mode
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.17,0:09:47.45,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后切到解题模式
Dialogue: 1,0:09:47.45,0:09:52.76,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the solver will realize okay well after the zero goes there then we have to put two light bulbs there
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.45,0:09:52.76,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后解谜者会意识到，好吧，既然这有0，那么就必须在那里放两个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:09:52.76,0:09:57.69,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's go back into edit mode let's try putting some walls here and here
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.76,0:09:57.69,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们回到编辑模式，让我们试着放些墙壁，在这里和这里
Dialogue: 1,0:09:57.69,0:10:06.40,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}this will create a situation where that cell needs to be lit by a light bulb but the only possible location of a light bulb to light it up will be here
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.69,0:10:06.40,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这就创造出一种情况，这个格子需要被照亮，但唯一可能的位置是在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:10:06.40,0:10:11.26,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because anywhere else um you know we can't put a light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.40,0:10:11.26,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为其他地方，你知道我们不能把灯泡放在那里
Dialogue: 1,0:10:11.26,0:10:13.95,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, then we go back to answer mode and we stick a light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.26,0:10:13.95,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以我们回到解题模式，在那里放一个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:10:13.95,0:10:17.98,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh let's see what else let's try putting a wall here
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.95,0:10:17.98,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}呃，我们看看还有什么，我们试试在这里放一面墙
Dialogue: 1,0:10:17.98,0:10:22.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and maybe these two light bulbs we want them to infer together the next step
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.98,0:10:22.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许，对于这两个灯泡，我们想要让它们一起推出下一步
Dialogue: 1,0:10:22.14,0:10:26.75,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and let's try uh let's try putting a two here uh
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.14,0:10:26.75,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们试试，呃，让我们试试在这里放一个2
Dialogue: 1,0:10:26.75,0:10:30.72,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then our solver upon sort of seeing the top and bottom of this two have been ruled out
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.75,0:10:30.72,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后解谜者看到这个2的上面和下面都被排除了
Dialogue: 1,0:10:30.72,0:10:33.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}can put two more light bulbs there and there
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.72,0:10:33.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}就能在这里和这里放两个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:10:33.08,0:10:35.90,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh okay pretty good
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.08,0:10:35.90,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}呃，好的，不错
Dialogue: 1,0:10:35.90,0:10:41.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}now we're gonna have to make sure like we can't put a block there otherwise it will have invalidated that part of the solution
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.90,0:10:41.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在我们要确保我们不会在这里放一个墙，否则就会使之前那块解失效了
Dialogue: 1,0:10:41.92,0:10:48.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, we kind of have to keep in mind uh what are the bits that are required to sort of make the puzzle that we've done so far work
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.92,0:10:48.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以我们必须记得让我们目前的谜题生效的那些部分
Dialogue: 1,0:10:48.64,0:10:54.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um but you know if we feel that uh the lights are shining too far and we need to add more obstacles
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.64,0:10:54.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果感觉灯光覆盖得太远了，我们需要加一些障碍
Dialogue: 1,0:10:54.52,0:10:56.76,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we could add some obstacles on this side let's say
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.52,0:10:56.76,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以在这一边增加一些障碍物，比如说
Dialogue: 1,0:10:56.76,0:11:00.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um you know I’m not sure what we're going to do there
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.76,0:11:00.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我还不知道要在这里做什么
Dialogue: 1,0:11:00.80,0:11:06.49,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe uh well let's see we could try uh we could try putting a 1 here
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.80,0:11:06.49,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许...让我看看，我们可以试试...我们可以试试在这里放一个1
Dialogue: 1,0:11:06.49,0:11:10.27,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and that will allow us to rule out these two cells
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.49,0:11:10.27,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这样我们就可以排除掉这两个格子了
Dialogue: 1,0:11:10.27,0:11:15.90,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}now that we've put one there can that do something interesting uh
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.27,0:11:15.90,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}既然我们已经放了个1，这能带来什么有趣的事情呢
Dialogue: 1,0:11:15.90,0:11:19.74,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}well we could maybe put a block there and then we know a light bulb has to go in the corner
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.90,0:11:19.74,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许我们可以在这里放一个墙，然后我们知道必须放一个灯泡在角落里
Dialogue: 1,0:11:19.74,0:11:26.20,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh sure let's do that because that you know these two cells both have to be lit up but we can't put one there
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.74,0:11:26.20,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们这么做吧，因为这两个格子都得被点亮，但我们不能放在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:11:26.20,0:11:29.66,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe this could also reveal something to us uh
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.20,0:11:29.66,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}或许这能揭示些东西
Dialogue: 1,0:11:29.66,0:11:32.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's try let's try something a little more sophisticated here
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.66,0:11:32.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们试试些更复杂的东西吧
Dialogue: 1,0:11:32.92,0:11:37.53,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's copy the trick from that previous Akari puzzle whereby
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.92,0:11:37.53,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们借鉴一下之前那个点灯谜题的技巧
Dialogue: 1,0:11:37.53,0:11:39.71,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because one side of this two has been blocked
Dialogue: 0,0:11:37.53,0:11:39.71,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}由于这个2的一边已经被覆盖了
Dialogue: 1,0:11:39.71,0:11:43.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we know that this can't be a light bulb and this can't be a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.71,0:11:43.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们知道这里不能放灯泡，这里也不行
Dialogue: 1,0:11:43.16,0:11:48.22,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because either of these would rule out too many spots and the two would only have one location left
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.16,0:11:48.22,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为这两种情况都会排除掉太多位置，使得这个2旁边只剩一个位置了
Dialogue: 1,0:11:48.22,0:11:49.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, let's try that
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.22,0:11:49.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，我们试试这么做
Dialogue: 1,0:11:49.44,0:11:51.61,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}then we learned that these are not light bulbs
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.44,0:11:51.61,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后我们知道，这些地方不能放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:11:51.61,0:11:58.40,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's try well we could try putting a two there and then we'll place those two there
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.61,0:11:58.40,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们试试，我们可以试着在那里放个2，然后这两个灯泡就在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:11:58.40,0:12:03.96,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which then feed back into the two that we were just in and give us two light bulbs there and there
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.40,0:12:03.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后这就能反馈到我们之前那个2，这样就确定了在这里和这里的两个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:12:03.96,0:12:05.31,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}lovely
Dialogue: 0,0:12:03.96,0:12:05.31,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}很不错
Dialogue: 1,0:12:05.31,0:12:12.35,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh what now and you can see how this just flows like I’m literally just making this up as I go I do not have a plan
Dialogue: 0,0:12:05.31,0:12:12.35,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在你可以看到这一切是如何流畅进行的，我其实就是即兴发挥的，没有一个计划
Dialogue: 1,0:12:12.35,0:12:17.98,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um maybe I could have a plan and I could try to make a puzzle that has a certain pattern or goes around the grid in a certain way
Dialogue: 0,0:12:12.35,0:12:17.98,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许我可以有个计划，我可以试着做一个有某种模式的谜题，或者以某种方式绕着网格走
Dialogue: 1,0:12:17.98,0:12:22.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like maybe I want the flow to kind of go in a circle and come into the middle that can be a nice motif
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.98,0:12:22.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如我想让这个解谜的过程绕成一个圈，然后最后到中间来，这是一个不错的模式
Dialogue: 1,0:12:22.84,0:12:30.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's try doing that so let's make it so this one kind of goes up and gives us some logic in the upward direction
Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.84,0:12:30.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们把它做成这样，这个1能给我们一下关于上面的逻辑
Dialogue: 1,0:12:30.14,0:12:37.37,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like maybe this one and this one can combine and we can have uh let's try and think let's put a number there maybe
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.14,0:12:37.37,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许这两个可以一起，我们能…让我想想，我们也许在这里放个数字
Dialogue: 1,0:12:37.37,0:12:46.01,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe a one and maybe all three of these combine to force a light bulb uh in the upward direction there
Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.37,0:12:46.01,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许是个1，也许这三个一起就使得在上面必须有个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:12:46.01,0:12:48.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}whoops answer mode boom
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.01,0:12:48.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}噢，点错了
Dialogue: 1,0:12:48.44,0:12:53.50,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and now this will sort of push logic horizontally
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.44,0:12:53.50,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在我们得让逻辑链往水平方向发展
Dialogue: 1,0:12:53.50,0:12:59.96,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's see we could we could put one here maybe we could put a one here
Dialogue: 0,0:12:53.50,0:12:59.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我看看，我们可以在这里放个1
Dialogue: 1,0:12:59.96,0:13:01.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we have that one
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.96,0:13:01.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后放这个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:13:01.56,0:13:03.55,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe these two then are going to combine together
Dialogue: 0,0:13:01.56,0:13:03.55,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许这两个灯泡能一起（推出后面的结果）
Dialogue: 1,0:13:03.55,0:13:09.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}i mean we can we can reuse tricks in a new setting or we could have new tricks or we could have the same tricks
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.55,0:13:09.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以在新的环境下复用之前的技巧，或者也可以用新的技巧
Dialogue: 1,0:13:09.56,0:13:13.47,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and all of these will take the solver on a different journey depending on what we want to do
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.56,0:13:13.47,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而所有这些都会把解谜者带入一个不同的旅程，这取决于我们想做什么
Dialogue: 1,0:13:13.47,0:13:23.39,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you know if we want to be artful and we want to have a certain sort of a plan to create something spectacular we can do that
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.47,0:13:23.39,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果我们想要艺术性，想要按某种计划来创造一种看起来令人惊叹的东西，我们可以这样做
Dialogue: 1,0:13:23.39,0:13:29.79,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but we can also just make something flowy and simple and fast that is easy to solve and players can get through quickly
Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.39,0:13:29.79,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但我们也可以就做一些流畅的、简单的、快速的、容易解决的、玩家可以快速完成的东西
Dialogue: 1,0:13:29.79,0:13:34.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it all depends on what we're feeling like or what we want to do
Dialogue: 0,0:13:29.79,0:13:34.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这一切都取决于我们的感觉或我们想做什么
Dialogue: 1,0:13:34.14,0:13:37.60,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's see so that was the most recent one that I put in
Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.14,0:13:37.60,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们看看，这是我刚放进去的那一个
Dialogue: 1,0:13:37.60,0:13:40.99,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}I want that to force something

Dialogue: 1,0:13:54.36,0:14:01.85,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}well let's just try putting a two here and blocking off a few things maybe that
Dialogue: 0,0:13:54.36,0:14:01.85,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}好吧，让我试着在这个放个2，然后加点墙来挡住一些东西
Dialogue: 1,0:14:01.85,0:14:06.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so that will well do we want to have this so open I guess that's okay
Dialogue: 0,0:14:01.85,0:14:06.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这样就可以了，我们想要让这部分敞开吗？我想应该可以
Dialogue: 1,0:14:06.84,0:14:12.28,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh we'll force a few of these like that and then maybe we can put one like that
Dialogue: 0,0:14:06.84,0:14:12.28,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以就像这样迫使一些地方…然后也许我们可以像这样放个墙
Dialogue: 1,0:14:12.28,0:14:17.85,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we could even put a zero here which will then mean we cannot put one there
Dialogue: 0,0:14:12.28,0:14:17.85,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们甚至可以在这里放一个0，这样就意味着我们不能在放灯泡了
Dialogue: 1,0:14:17.85,0:14:24.25,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}something that's interesting sometimes is to have a long row where you can't put light bulbs anywhere on them
Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.85,0:14:24.25,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有时候这种很长一整排都不能放灯泡的情况是很有趣的
Dialogue: 1,0:14:24.25,0:14:26.49,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}for example say I put a zero here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:24.25,0:14:26.49,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如说我在这里放一个0
Dialogue: 1,0:14:26.49,0:14:32.19,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then let's see we can block this off we don't need that
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.49,0:14:32.19,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后让我看看，我们可以把这个挡住，我们不需要这个
Dialogue: 1,0:14:32.19,0:14:34.62,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but then the zero will rule out all of these
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.19,0:14:34.62,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但这个0会排除所有的这些地方
Dialogue: 1,0:14:34.62,0:14:40.25,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then if you look at this the only place this can be illuminated is by placing a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.62,0:14:40.25,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后你可以看到，唯一能照亮这个地方的就是在这里放一个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:14:40.25,0:14:46.01,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh boom and the only place where this cell can be illuminated by placing a light bulb in that cell itself boom
Dialogue: 0,0:14:40.25,0:14:46.01,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后要把这个格子照亮就得在它本身放个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:14:46.01,0:14:52.03,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe we can do this one more time
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.01,0:14:52.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许我们可以再做一次
Dialogue: 1,0:14:52.03,0:14:56.57,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}if we put a zero here then that will rule out this
Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.03,0:14:56.57,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果我们在这里放个0，那么就可以排除这个
Dialogue: 1,0:14:56.57,0:15:00.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then the only way that cell can be illuminated is by putting a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:56.57,0:15:00.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后唯一可以照亮这个格子的方法就是在这里放一个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:15:00.80,0:15:05.72,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh whoops uh boom okay um
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.80,0:15:05.72,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}噢，又点错了
Dialogue: 1,0:15:05.72,0:15:10.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}how's that working pretty good I didn't need this for anything
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.72,0:15:10.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}效果如何？很好。我不需要这个东西了
Dialogue: 1,0:15:10.08,0:15:14.88,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe I want this light bulb to infer something in the middle
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.08,0:15:14.88,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许我想让这个灯泡推断出中间的一些东西来

Dialogue: 0,0:15:14.88,0:15:19.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我在想一个好办法来做到这个事情
Dialogue: 1,0:15:19.36,0:15:27.04,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}did we need that? maybe we could just have a two here
Dialogue: 0,0:15:19.36,0:15:27.04,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们需要这个吗？也许我们可以在这里放一个2
Dialogue: 1,0:15:27.04,0:15:31.20,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we will have to put two light bulbs there

Dialogue: 1,0:15:31.20,0:15:37.45,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then maybe this is where the final light bulb goes to eliminate that one
Dialogue: 0,0:15:31.20,0:15:37.45,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后也许这就是最后那一个灯泡的位置，来照亮那个格子
Dialogue: 1,0:15:37.45,0:15:39.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and we can check our answer
Dialogue: 0,0:15:37.45,0:15:39.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}接着我们可以检查一下我们的答案
Dialogue: 1,0:15:39.17,0:15:51.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}now uh you know we we erased and and re-added a bunch of things so we really should check our whole solution in order to confirm that the the logic flow is intact
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.17,0:15:51.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在我们应该检查一下整个解，以确认逻辑流程是完整的
Dialogue: 1,0:15:51.08,0:15:54.34,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the way to do that is erase our answer and do a complete test solve
Dialogue: 0,0:15:51.08,0:15:54.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}做的方法是，我们擦掉我们的答案然后做一个完整的测试过程
Dialogue: 1,0:15:54.34,0:15:56.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, let's just pretend we're solving the puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:15:54.34,0:15:56.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那么，假装我们在解这个谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:15:56.52,0:16:01.19,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you know I would do all this
Dialogue: 0,0:15:56.52,0:16:01.19,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你知道，我会做这样一些
Dialogue: 1,0:16:01.19,0:16:05.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}is there anything I can deduce right now there actually is I can put a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.19,0:16:05.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有什么我现在就能推断出的吗？事实上，我可以在这里放个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:16:05.16,0:16:08.81,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because I know that this cell has to be illuminated and nothing else can light it up
Dialogue: 0,0:16:05.16,0:16:08.81,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为我知道这个格子必须被照亮，而其他地方都不行
Dialogue: 1,0:16:08.81,0:16:13.54,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you know does that spoil the aesthetic of my puzzle going all the way around
Dialogue: 0,0:16:08.81,0:16:13.54,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这会破坏我之前设计的绕整个网格一圈的逻辑流的美感吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:16:13.54,0:16:17.89,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}well maybe i might decide to fix this or I might decide I just don't care that's fine
Dialogue: 0,0:16:13.54,0:16:17.89,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}好吧，我可能会决定去修复这个问题，或者我也可能决定不管它，问题不大
Dialogue: 1,0:16:17.89,0:16:20.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but the intended first step was here
Dialogue: 0,0:16:17.89,0:16:20.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但我们设计的第一步是在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:16:20.52,0:16:23.78,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we can get this light bulb uh
Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.52,0:16:23.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后我们可以得到这个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:16:23.78,0:16:26.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}sometimes it's interesting to think like what if the player doesn't see this move
Dialogue: 0,0:16:23.78,0:16:26.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有时候想一下如果玩家没有看到应该这样走该怎么办？这还挺有意思的
Dialogue: 1,0:16:26.98,0:16:30.69,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like what if the solver just has to go somewhere else can they make progress elsewhere
Dialogue: 0,0:16:26.98,0:16:30.69,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如说，如果解题者得从别的位置继续，那他们能在别的位置取得进展吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:16:30.69,0:16:35.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um like you might notice that you can't put two here because that would violate the one
Dialogue: 0,0:16:30.69,0:16:35.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你可能会注意到，你不能在里放两个灯泡，因为那会违反这个1
Dialogue: 1,0:16:35.56,0:16:37.86,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and we need sort of two of these three to be lit up
Dialogue: 0,0:16:35.56,0:16:37.86,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们需要在三个中的两个位置放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:16:37.86,0:16:42.09,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and therefore, this one if it wasn't lit up would force this which would be a contradiction
Dialogue: 0,0:16:37.86,0:16:42.09,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此，如果这个位置没有灯泡，那么就会迫使这里形成矛盾
Dialogue: 1,0:16:42.09,0:16:43.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, this one has to be lit up
Dialogue: 0,0:16:42.09,0:16:43.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，这里必须放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:16:43.56,0:16:48.23,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}does that help me move forward I’m not sure I think I still need to know which one of these two it is
Dialogue: 0,0:16:43.56,0:16:48.23,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这能帮助我们取得进展吗？还不确定，我想我还是需要知道这两个里面选哪一个
Dialogue: 1,0:16:48.23,0:16:51.49,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so that would allow me to make that discovery
Dialogue: 0,0:16:48.23,0:16:51.49,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那就会让我取得这样一个发现
Dialogue: 1,0:16:51.49,0:16:53.09,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then so we get that we get that
Dialogue: 0,0:16:51.49,0:16:53.09,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后我们得到了这个，又得到了这个
Dialogue: 1,0:16:53.09,0:16:55.85,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we said that would give us this
Dialogue: 0,0:16:53.09,0:16:55.85,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这会让我们得到这个
Dialogue: 1,0:16:55.85,0:16:57.89,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which would give us this
Dialogue: 0,0:16:55.85,0:16:57.89,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}又让我们得到这个
Dialogue: 1,0:16:57.89,0:17:00.26,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and then this 2 gives us that
Dialogue: 0,0:16:57.89,0:17:00.26,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后这个2又让我们确定了这个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:00.26,0:17:02.76,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}that one gives us those two
Dialogue: 0,0:17:00.26,0:17:02.76,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那个1又确定了这两个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:02.76,0:17:04.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which gives us that
Dialogue: 0,0:17:02.76,0:17:04.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这又让我们确定了那个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:04.17,0:17:07.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which then gives us this to sort of force that
Dialogue: 0,0:17:04.17,0:17:07.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后确定了这个，固定了那个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:07.17,0:17:10.95,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which then gives us this to force that and that's sort of just an add-on
Dialogue: 0,0:17:07.17,0:17:10.95,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这就让我们确定了这个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:10.95,0:17:15.30,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}then those two which finally reveal where that final light bulb in this row has to go
Dialogue: 0,0:17:10.95,0:17:15.30,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后是这两个，这就最终揭示了这排我们需要放置的最后那个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:17:15.30,0:17:16.07,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which is there
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.30,0:17:16.07,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}就是那里
Dialogue: 1,0:17:16.07,0:17:19.27,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, most of our solution path is intact
Dialogue: 0,0:17:16.07,0:17:19.27,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，我们的解法的大部分路径都是完整的
Dialogue: 1,0:17:19.27,0:17:22.28,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}there's maybe a few places where we could skip ahead a little bit
Dialogue: 0,0:17:19.27,0:17:22.28,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许有几个地方我们可以跳过去一点儿
Dialogue: 1,0:17:22.28,0:17:24.71,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}do we want to go back back and fix it
Dialogue: 0,0:17:22.28,0:17:24.71,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们需要回去修复它吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:17:24.71,0:17:29.83,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we could if we were really trying to go for a specific uh look or a specific theme
Dialogue: 0,0:17:24.71,0:17:29.83,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以这么做，如果我们真的是想追求一个特定的形式或主题的话
Dialogue: 1,0:17:29.83,0:17:33.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but the point is you have a lot of freedom as a puzzle designer to create that
Dialogue: 0,0:17:29.83,0:17:33.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但关键点还是，作为一个谜题设计师，你有很大的自由来创造这些东西
Dialogue: 1,0:17:33.80,0:17:42.57,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and this method of designing from the front or forward design allows you to really have quite tight control over the solution experience of the person solving the puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:17:33.80,0:17:42.57,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这种从正面设计的方法，或者说前向设计，可以让你对解谜者的解谜体验有严格的控制
Dialogue: 1,0:17:42.57,0:17:46.41,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh if you do it correctly and if you're good at it which is is hard right
Dialogue: 0,0:17:42.57,0:17:46.41,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}前提是你做得对或者你很擅长这一点的话。但这很难，对嘛？
Dialogue: 1,0:17:46.41,0:17:49.41,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like i've been doing this for many years so I have some experience with this
Dialogue: 0,0:17:46.41,0:17:49.41,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如说，我已经做了很多年了，所以我会有些经验
Dialogue: 1,0:17:49.41,0:17:59.46,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and you know i have a sense of like where it could go wrong or what types of assumptions i should and shouldn't make when i'm making these sort of you know when i'm adding a new square to the grid
Dialogue: 0,0:17:49.41,0:17:59.46,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}当我在网格中添加东西时，我会对哪里可能出错、我应不应该做出什么样的假设有一定的感觉
Dialogue: 1,0:17:59.46,0:18:04.13,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}how is this going to affect the solution path based on what i've created so far
Dialogue: 0,0:17:59.46,0:18:04.13,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}以及基于我目前所创造的东西，这将如何影响解谜路径？
Dialogue: 1,0:18:04.13,0:18:08.49,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and you have to have a good sense of how these puzzles solve in order to be able to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:18:04.13,0:18:08.49,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你得对这些谜题的解法有一个很好的感觉，才能做到这一点
Dialogue: 1,0:18:08.49,0:18:12.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, some of the best composers of these puzzles are also the best solvers of them
Dialogue: 0,0:18:08.49,0:18:12.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，一些最好的谜题创作者也是最好的解谜者
Dialogue: 1,0:18:12.52,0:18:20.26,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because they themselves are able to once they place one thing in the grid they can deduce exactly all that can be deduced from it
Dialogue: 0,0:18:12.52,0:18:20.26,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为一旦他们自己在网格中添加什么东西，他们就能准确推导出所有能被推导出的东西
Dialogue: 1,0:18:20.26,0:18:24.29,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and therefore, have a really good understanding of what the solver experience is going to be
Dialogue: 0,0:18:20.26,0:18:24.29,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此他们也就对解题者的体验有很好的了解
Dialogue: 1,0:18:24.29,0:18:26.66,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um with logic puzzles that's true

Dialogue: 1,0:19:34.25,0:19:43.21,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because it's it's sort of like the soundness and completeness meeting together implying that both the existence and uniqueness of the puzzle have been established
Dialogue: 0,0:19:34.25,0:19:43.21,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为这类似于说，可靠性和完备性同时满足，就意味着谜题的存在性和独特性都被确立了
Dialogue: 1,0:19:43.21,0:19:50.12,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and that's different than a puzzle where you guess and you find the answer and you don't even know is this the unique answer is this the only answer
Dialogue: 0,0:19:43.21,0:19:50.12,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这与那种猜答案的谜题不同，那种谜题里面你找到了答案而你甚至不能确定是不是唯一的答案

Dialogue: 0,0:20:01.51,0:20:09.06,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而这就是促成这种交流的原因，因为你知道这就是谜题设计者希望你在解题时做的事情

Dialogue: 0,0:23:53.25,0:23:59.01,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而它本身开发者设计的是一个很好的解法，但在我玩的一周目中我甚至没见到过这种解法
Dialogue: 1,0:23:59.01,0:24:03.69,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}I basically had to cheat and look up the answer before I learned what the intended solution was
Dialogue: 0,0:23:59.01,0:24:03.69,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我恐怕得通过作弊或者查找答案才能知道预定的解法是什么
Dialogue: 1,0:24:03.69,0:24:12.90,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and I think my experience playing that game would have been a lot better if I had been coerced toward the intended solution more strongly
Dialogue: 0,0:24:03.69,0:24:12.90,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我想，如果我被更有力地迫使去寻找预定解法的话，我玩这个游戏的体验会好很多
Dialogue: 1,0:24:12.90,0:24:19.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}anyways like deductive puzzles kind of need to have unique solutions
Dialogue: 0,0:24:12.90,0:24:19.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}总之，逻辑推理型的谜题还是需要有独一无二的解法的
Dialogue: 1,0:24:19.24,0:24:25.51,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because the flow demands that you sort of prove every step you're not guessing right
Dialogue: 0,0:24:19.24,0:24:25.51,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为解谜的流程就要求你去证明每一步，毕竟你不是在猜测，是吧？
Dialogue: 1,0:24:25.51,0:24:30.89,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so you need to be able to prove every step that you move forward on and therefore you have to just end up with one solution at the end
Dialogue: 0,0:24:25.51,0:24:30.89,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以你每前进一步都需要做出证明，因此必须在最后只得到一个解法
Dialogue: 1,0:24:30.89,0:24:35.11,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you wouldn't be able to have deductive flow if the solution wasn't unique
Dialogue: 0,0:24:30.89,0:24:35.11,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果解法不唯一的话，你就不可能有一个演绎推理的思维流
Dialogue: 1,0:24:35.11,0:24:39.78,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um so many types of puzzles chess puzzles logic puzzles etc. demand solutions
Dialogue: 0,0:24:35.11,0:24:39.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，许多类型的谜题，如象棋棋谜，逻辑谜题等，都需要（独一无二的）解法
Dialogue: 1,0:24:39.78,0:24:43.69,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but many other types of puzzles ought to have unique solutions
Dialogue: 0,0:24:39.78,0:24:43.69,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但是许多其他类型的谜题也应该有唯一的解法
Dialogue: 1,0:24:43.69,0:24:48.74,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because of the aesthetics and because of the need to have a unique eureka moment and to force that on the player
Dialogue: 0,0:24:43.69,0:24:48.74,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为需要一个独特的尤里卡时刻并将其带给玩家
Dialogue: 1,0:24:48.74,0:24:51.11,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}unique solutions are just a way to facilitate that
Dialogue: 0,0:24:48.74,0:24:51.11,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}唯一的解法正是促进这一目标的一种方式
Dialogue: 1,0:24:51.11,0:24:54.18,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, I advocate uniqueness whenever somebody asks me
Dialogue: 0,0:24:51.11,0:24:54.18,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，每当有人问我，我都主张解法要有唯一性
Dialogue: 1,0:24:54.18,0:24:58.28,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you know and for those point-and-click adventure games that have multiple solutions to some puzzles
Dialogue: 0,0:24:54.18,0:24:58.28,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你知道，对于那些其中谜题有多种解法的点击冒险游戏来说
Dialogue: 1,0:24:58.28,0:25:00.90,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}that can be okay like
Dialogue: 0,0:24:58.28,0:25:00.90,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}（有多种解法）可能问题不大
Dialogue: 1,0:25:00.90,0:25:05.70,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}there are there are many downsides right like you're doing extra work that the player might not even see
Dialogue: 0,0:25:00.90,0:25:05.70,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但也有很多坏处，比如你是在做一些玩家可能根本看不到的无用功
Dialogue: 1,0:25:05.70,0:25:09.99,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um sometimes you'll end up with an extra item and not even know what it was for
Dialogue: 0,0:25:05.70,0:25:09.99,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有时你在游戏中会得到一个额外的物品，但你甚至不知道它是用来做什么的
Dialogue: 1,0:25:09.99,0:25:16.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um you know like oh that was for the second possible solution to that puzzle and you never used it
Dialogue: 0,0:25:09.99,0:25:16.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你知道，那是给那个谜题的第二种解法用的，但你从来没有用过它
Dialogue: 1,0:25:16.52,0:25:20.61,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like you want to have this feeling of every item in the game having had a purpose right
Dialogue: 0,0:25:16.52,0:25:20.61,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你会想有这样的感觉，游戏中的每件物品都应该有一个用途，对吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:25:20.61,0:25:22.47,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like I got that thing what was it for um
Dialogue: 0,0:25:20.61,0:25:22.47,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}就比如我得到了那个东西，那它有什么用呢？
Dialogue: 1,0:25:22.47,0:25:26.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}if you leave the game without feeling that you understood that purpose
Dialogue: 0,0:25:22.47,0:25:26.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果你在离开游戏时，没有感觉到你理解了那个物品的用途
Dialogue: 1,0:25:26.44,0:25:32.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}then sometimes it can feel a little incomplete or it feels like you know the communication was lost at some point um
Dialogue: 0,0:25:26.44,0:25:32.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那有时就会感觉到有点不完整，或者就像感觉从某一刻起你失去了与开发者之间的交流
Dialogue: 1,0:25:32.84,0:25:37.77,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you know so there's a lot to think about with regards to uniqueness
Dialogue: 0,0:25:32.84,0:25:37.77,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以关于唯一性的问题还是有很多东西需要思考的
