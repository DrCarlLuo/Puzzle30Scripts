Dialogue: 1,0:00:03.45,0:00:11.00,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um here we're gonna get into some real nitty-gritty puzzle construction and design stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.45,0:00:11.00,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}在这一部分，我们将探讨一些关于谜题构造与设计的一些真正重要的细节
Dialogue: 1,0:00:11.00,0:00:16.12,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um so you know this is the meat of the talk really um
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.00,0:00:16.12,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你懂的，这部分才真正是这次讲座的重点
Dialogue: 1,0:00:16.12,0:00:20.03,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}lesson number 21 is “speak playfully to the solver”
Dialogue: 0,0:00:16.12,0:00:20.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}第21课是 「与解题者愉快地交谈」
Dialogue: 2,0:00:20.03,0:00:25.02,Annote,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}（译者注：Akari Puzzle，中文叫《点灯游戏》、《点亮游戏》、《数灯》，由Nikoli于2001年首次发布）
Dialogue: 1,0:00:20.03,0:00:25.02,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and uh to illustrate this I want to show you an akari puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.03,0:00:25.02,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}为了说明这一点，我想给你们看一个《点灯游戏》（Akari Puzzle）
Dialogue: 1,0:00:25.02,0:00:28.54,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}akari is a puzzle type where you're given a grid it's a logic puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.02,0:00:28.54,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}点灯游戏是一种逻辑解谜，里面会给你一个网格
Dialogue: 1,0:00:28.54,0:00:32.57,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and there's some cells that have different numbers in them
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.54,0:00:32.57,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有些格子里会有不同的数字
Dialogue: 1,0:00:32.57,0:00:37.50,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the goal is to place light bulbs in the grid in some of the empty cells
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.57,0:00:37.50,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}目标是在一些空格子里放上灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:00:37.50,0:00:39.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and there are three rules
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.50,0:00:39.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有三条规则
Dialogue: 1,0:00:39.80,0:00:49.34,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}one is that the lights shine horizontally and vertically and your goal is to cover the whole grid to illuminate the whole grid using lights
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.80,0:00:49.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}第一条，灯泡会水平和垂直地照亮一行和一列，而你的目标是用灯光照亮整个网格
Dialogue: 1,0:00:49.34,0:00:51.77,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}however there are two constraints
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.34,0:00:51.77,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但是有两个限制
Dialogue: 1,0:00:51.77,0:00:56.00,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}one is two lights are not allowed to illuminate each other
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.77,0:00:56.00,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}一是两盏灯不允许互相照亮到对方
Dialogue: 1,0:00:56.00,0:01:04.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the second is the numbers on the grid tell you the the number of lights adjacent to that number in the sort of north south east west directions
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.00,0:01:04.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}二是，网格上的数字告诉你该格子上下左右相邻的灯泡数量
Dialogue: 1,0:01:04.44,0:01:10.01,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, a two for example like this one has two lights next to it here and here
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.44,0:01:10.01,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如说，这个数字2，旁边有两盏灯，这里和这里
Dialogue: 1,0:01:10.01,0:01:14.36,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and this one has one light next to it there and so on that's it
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.01,0:01:14.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个1旁边就有一盏灯，就是这样
Dialogue: 1,0:01:14.36,0:01:18.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um so I want to show you the solution to this puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.36,0:01:18.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我想给你们展示下这个谜题的解答过程
Dialogue: 1,0:01:18.14,0:01:21.34,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh and we will observe some remarkable things
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.14,0:01:21.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们将观察到一些了不起的事情
Dialogue: 1,0:01:21.34,0:01:27.42,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um so this is a site called puzzlink where you can play a lot of these types of logic puzzles
Dialogue: 0,0:01:21.34,0:01:27.42,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这谁一个叫做puzz.link的网站，里面你可以玩到很多这种类型的逻辑谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:01:27.42,0:01:30.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and we'll take you through the solution
Dialogue: 0,0:01:27.42,0:01:30.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我将带你过一遍解答过程
Dialogue: 1,0:01:30.24,0:01:32.73,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}at first actually this is this is a somewhat difficult puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.24,0:01:32.73,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}首先，这是个有点难度的谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:01:32.73,0:01:35.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}this is not necessarily a completely beginner level puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.73,0:01:35.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这并不是一个初级的谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:01:35.16,0:01:40.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}at first you may not find any immediate location to make progress
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.16,0:01:40.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}一开始你可能找不到任何一个直接看得出来的位置来取得进展
Dialogue: 1,0:01:40.80,0:01:43.55,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but one thing to look at is this one in the corner
Dialogue: 0,0:01:40.80,0:01:43.55,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但值得注意的是这个角落里的1
Dialogue: 1,0:01:43.55,0:01:48.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, we know that there's either a light bulb here or here
Dialogue: 0,0:01:43.55,0:01:48.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们知道要么有个灯泡在这里，要么在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:01:48.80,0:01:51.42,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but we don't know which of those two it is yet
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.80,0:01:51.42,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但我们还不能确定是其中哪一个
Dialogue: 1,0:01:51.42,0:01:55.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}however, one thing we can deduce is that there cannot be a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.42,0:01:55.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然而，我们可以推出的是，这里是不可能有灯泡的
Dialogue: 1,0:01:55.84,0:02:02.36,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because if there was a light bulb here then both this cell and that cell will be ruled out from having a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.84,0:02:02.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为如果这里有一个灯泡，那么这个还有那个格子都不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:02.36,0:02:04.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because two light bulbs cannot illuminate each other
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.36,0:02:04.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为两个灯泡不能互相照亮对方
Dialogue: 1,0:02:04.80,0:02:08.32,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um therefore there can't be a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.80,0:02:08.32,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此这里不可能有一个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:08.32,0:02:12.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, using a dot we can mark this cell as a cell that doesn't have a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.32,0:02:12.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以我们用一个小点来代表这里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:12.92,0:02:17.72,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}another way of seeing this is that if there was a light bulb there or a light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.92,0:02:17.72,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}从另一个角度来看这个问题，如果这里有个灯泡，或那里有个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:17.72,0:02:21.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}in both cases this cell is ruled out from containing a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.72,0:02:21.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}在这两种情况下，这个格子都被排除在外
Dialogue: 1,0:02:21.56,0:02:24.38,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}therefore in both cases there's no light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.56,0:02:24.38,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此，在这两种情况下，这里都不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:24.38,0:02:29.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we can make similar progress by looking at this two here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.38,0:02:29.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以用类似的方法来看这个2
Dialogue: 1,0:02:29.24,0:02:33.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}there's sort of three candidate locations where a light bulb could be
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.24,0:02:33.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这里有三个候选位置来放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:33.08,0:02:36.03,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but only two of them will contain light bulbs
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.08,0:02:36.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但其中只有两个会放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:36.03,0:02:40.19,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}however we can deduce that this cell right here cannot contain a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:02:36.03,0:02:40.19,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然而，我们可以推断出，这一格不可能包含灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:40.19,0:02:47.10,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}otherwise there would only be one other space left adjacent to this too because these two cells would both be ruled out
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.19,0:02:47.10,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}否则这个2旁边就只剩一个能放灯泡的格子了，因为这两格都被覆盖了
Dialogue: 1,0:02:47.10,0:02:50.11,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}therefore there cannot be a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.10,0:02:50.11,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此这里不可能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:02:50.11,0:02:56.76,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, knowing that these two cells cannot be light bulbs allows us to make additional progress
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.11,0:02:56.76,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，知道这两格不能放灯泡让我们有了更多的进展
Dialogue: 1,0:02:56.76,0:03:02.97,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}if we look at this two right down here we may also deduce that this cell can't be a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.76,0:03:02.97,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果我们看一下下面这个2，我们也能推断出这一格不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:02.97,0:03:07.45,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because again it would rule out two possible locations of the three that could be light bulbs
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.97,0:03:07.45,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为它也把三个格子中的两个位置给覆盖掉了
Dialogue: 1,0:03:07.45,0:03:09.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}therefore there's no light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.45,0:03:09.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此那里不能放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:09.24,0:03:16.35,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}similarly there's no light bulb here because it would rule out those two cells leaving only one place remaining for another light bulb adjacent to this two
Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.24,0:03:16.35,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}同样地，这里也不能有灯泡，因为它将覆盖掉这两格，只剩下一个与这个2相邻的位置了
Dialogue: 1,0:03:16.35,0:03:18.27,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so there's no light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.35,0:03:18.27,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以这里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:18.27,0:03:22.30,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and now we can look at this one and do similar logic
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.27,0:03:22.30,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在我们可以看这个1，做类似的逻辑
Dialogue: 1,0:03:22.30,0:03:26.72,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}there can't be a light bulb here because it would rule out both of these, therefore that's not a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.30,0:03:26.72,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这里不能有灯泡，因为它将覆盖这两格，所以不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:26.72,0:03:34.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and that chains into the next two and now we can't have a light bulb here or here because they would both rule out too many locations
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.72,0:03:34.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后逻辑链走到下个2，这里或这里都不能有灯泡，因为它们覆盖掉了太多位置
Dialogue: 1,0:03:34.14,0:03:39.39,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and using the same type of chaining logic we could see on this two there can't be light bulbs here and there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.14,0:03:39.39,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}用同样的逻辑链，我们可以看到，对于这个2，这里和这里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:39.39,0:03:42.78,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then this dot implies that for this one there can't be a light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.39,0:03:42.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后这个点表明，对于这个1，那里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:42.78,0:03:46.75,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then this two is then implied that there are no light bulbs here or here
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.78,0:03:46.75,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后这个2，这里和这里也不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.75,0:03:50.78,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and now on this one we can learn that there's no light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.75,0:03:50.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后对这个1，我们知道这里不能有灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.78,0:03:57.24,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and on this one we can learn that there's no light bulb here because again it would rule out all the possible locations where a light bulb could be
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.78,0:03:57.24,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后对于这个1，我们知道这里不能有灯泡，因为一样的，它会覆盖所有可选位置

Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.82,0:08:56.89,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但这里，我就直接即兴创作了
Dialogue: 1,0:08:56.89,0:09:00.22,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, we're creating an Akari puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.89,0:09:00.22,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那么，我们是要创作一个点灯游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:09:00.22,0:09:04.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's make a low difficulty one and insert lots of easy steps
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.22,0:09:04.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们做一个低难度的，插入些简单的步骤
Dialogue: 1,0:09:04.44,0:09:07.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}something we might do is let's put in a zero
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.44,0:09:07.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们能做的是，我们先放个0进去
Dialogue: 1,0:09:07.84,0:09:10.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}a zero is sort of an obvious place to get started
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.84,0:09:10.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}0是一个很明显的可以作为起点的地方
Dialogue: 1,0:09:10.52,0:09:15.32,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it's a so-called “hook” it's a thing that the player will immediately take their pencil and put in something
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.52,0:09:15.32,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这就是一个所谓的引子，是一个能让玩家立即拿起笔填上的东西
Dialogue: 1,0:09:15.32,0:09:17.88,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and let me just zoom out a tick
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.32,0:09:17.88,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我缩小一点
Dialogue: 1,0:09:17.88,0:09:23.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}the method that we're using here is we're gonna place clues and solve the puzzle at the same time
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.88,0:09:23.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们这里要使用的方法是，我们放置线索的同时进行解谜的过程
Dialogue: 1,0:09:23.64,0:09:28.70,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and we're going to place clues in the order that the player would sort of notice them as they were solving the puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.64,0:09:28.70,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们要按照玩家在解谜时注意到的顺序来放置线索
Dialogue: 1,0:09:28.70,0:09:30.36,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, we flip into answer mode
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.70,0:09:30.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，我们切换到解题模式
Dialogue: 1,0:09:30.36,0:09:39.00,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then in answer mode we'll mark these two cells as cells that uh the solver will know are not light bulbs
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.36,0:09:39.00,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后在解题模式中，我们将这两个格子标记为不能放置灯泡的地方
Dialogue: 1,0:09:39.00,0:09:42.65,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we'll go back into edit mode and let's just add some more stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.00,0:09:42.65,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后我们回到编辑模式，再增加一些内容
Dialogue: 1,0:09:42.65,0:09:46.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um you know let's try putting a two here right
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.65,0:09:46.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们试着在这里放个2
Dialogue: 1,0:09:46.17,0:09:47.45,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we'll go into answer mode
Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.17,0:09:47.45,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后切到解题模式
Dialogue: 1,0:09:47.45,0:09:52.76,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the solver will realize okay well after the zero goes there then we have to put two light bulbs there
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.45,0:09:52.76,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后解谜者会意识到，好吧，既然这有0，那么就必须在那里放两个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:09:52.76,0:09:57.69,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's go back into edit mode let's try putting some walls here and here
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.76,0:09:57.69,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们回到编辑模式，让我们试着放些墙壁，在这里和这里
Dialogue: 1,0:09:57.69,0:10:06.40,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}this will create a situation where that cell needs to be lit by a light bulb but the only possible location of a light bulb to light it up will be here
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.69,0:10:06.40,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这就创造出一种情况，这个格子需要被照亮，但唯一可能的位置是在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:10:06.40,0:10:11.26,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because anywhere else um you know we can't put a light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.40,0:10:11.26,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为其他地方，你知道我们不能把灯泡放在那里
Dialogue: 1,0:10:11.26,0:10:13.95,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, then we go back to answer mode and we stick a light bulb there
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.26,0:10:13.95,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以我们回到解题模式，在那里放一个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:10:13.95,0:10:17.98,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh let's see what else let's try putting a wall here
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.95,0:10:17.98,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}呃，我们看看还有什么，我们试试在这里放一面墙
Dialogue: 1,0:10:17.98,0:10:22.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and maybe these two light bulbs we want them to infer together the next step
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.98,0:10:22.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许，对于这两个灯泡，我们想要让它们一起推出下一步
Dialogue: 1,0:10:22.14,0:10:26.75,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and let's try uh let's try putting a two here uh
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.14,0:10:26.75,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们试试，呃，让我们试试在这里放一个2
Dialogue: 1,0:10:26.75,0:10:30.72,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then our solver upon sort of seeing the top and bottom of this two have been ruled out
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.75,0:10:30.72,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后解谜者看到这个2的上面和下面都被排除了
Dialogue: 1,0:10:30.72,0:10:33.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}can put two more light bulbs there and there
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.72,0:10:33.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}就能在这里和这里放两个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:10:33.08,0:10:35.90,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh okay pretty good
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.08,0:10:35.90,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}呃，好的，不错
Dialogue: 1,0:10:35.90,0:10:41.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}now we're gonna have to make sure like we can't put a block there otherwise it will have invalidated that part of the solution
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.90,0:10:41.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在我们要确保我们不会在这里放一个墙，否则就会使之前那块解失效了
Dialogue: 1,0:10:41.92,0:10:48.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, we kind of have to keep in mind uh what are the bits that are required to sort of make the puzzle that we've done so far work
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.92,0:10:48.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以我们必须记得让我们目前的谜题生效的那些部分
Dialogue: 1,0:10:48.64,0:10:54.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um but you know if we feel that uh the lights are shining too far and we need to add more obstacles
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.64,0:10:54.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果感觉灯光覆盖得太远了，我们需要加一些障碍
Dialogue: 1,0:10:54.52,0:10:56.76,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we could add some obstacles on this side let's say
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.52,0:10:56.76,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以在这一边增加一些障碍物，比如说
Dialogue: 1,0:10:56.76,0:11:00.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um you know I’m not sure what we're going to do there
Dialogue: 0,0:10:56.76,0:11:00.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我还不知道要在这里做什么
Dialogue: 1,0:11:00.80,0:11:06.49,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe uh well let's see we could try uh we could try putting a 1 here
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.80,0:11:06.49,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许...让我看看，我们可以试试...我们可以试试在这里放一个1
Dialogue: 1,0:11:06.49,0:11:10.27,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and that will allow us to rule out these two cells
Dialogue: 0,0:11:06.49,0:11:10.27,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这样我们就可以排除掉这两个格子了
Dialogue: 1,0:11:10.27,0:11:15.90,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}now that we've put one there can that do something interesting uh
Dialogue: 0,0:11:10.27,0:11:15.90,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}既然我们已经放了个1，这能带来什么有趣的事情呢
Dialogue: 1,0:11:15.90,0:11:19.74,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}well we could maybe put a block there and then we know a light bulb has to go in the corner
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.90,0:11:19.74,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许我们可以在这里放一个墙，然后我们知道必须放一个灯泡在角落里
Dialogue: 1,0:11:19.74,0:11:26.20,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh sure let's do that because that you know these two cells both have to be lit up but we can't put one there
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.74,0:11:26.20,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们这么做吧，因为这两个格子都得被点亮，但我们不能放在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:11:26.20,0:11:29.66,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe this could also reveal something to us uh
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.20,0:11:29.66,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}或许这能揭示些东西
Dialogue: 1,0:11:29.66,0:11:32.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's try let's try something a little more sophisticated here
Dialogue: 0,0:11:29.66,0:11:32.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们试试些更复杂的东西吧
Dialogue: 1,0:11:32.92,0:11:37.53,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's copy the trick from that previous Akari puzzle whereby
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.92,0:11:37.53,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们借鉴一下之前那个点灯谜题的技巧
Dialogue: 1,0:11:37.53,0:11:39.71,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because one side of this two has been blocked
Dialogue: 0,0:11:37.53,0:11:39.71,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}由于这个2的一边已经被覆盖了
Dialogue: 1,0:11:39.71,0:11:43.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we know that this can't be a light bulb and this can't be a light bulb
Dialogue: 0,0:11:39.71,0:11:43.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们知道这里不能放灯泡，这里也不行
Dialogue: 1,0:11:43.16,0:11:48.22,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because either of these would rule out too many spots and the two would only have one location left
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.16,0:11:48.22,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为这两种情况都会排除掉太多位置，使得这个2旁边只剩一个位置了
Dialogue: 1,0:11:48.22,0:11:49.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, let's try that
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.22,0:11:49.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，我们试试这么做
Dialogue: 1,0:11:49.44,0:11:51.61,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}then we learned that these are not light bulbs
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.44,0:11:51.61,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后我们知道，这些地方不能放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:11:51.61,0:11:58.40,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's try well we could try putting a two there and then we'll place those two there
Dialogue: 0,0:11:51.61,0:11:58.40,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们试试，我们可以试着在那里放个2，然后这两个灯泡就在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:11:58.40,0:12:03.96,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which then feed back into the two that we were just in and give us two light bulbs there and there
Dialogue: 0,0:11:58.40,0:12:03.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后这就能反馈到我们之前那个2，这样就确定了在这里和这里的两个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:12:03.96,0:12:05.31,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}lovely
Dialogue: 0,0:12:03.96,0:12:05.31,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}很不错
Dialogue: 1,0:12:05.31,0:12:12.35,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh what now and you can see how this just flows like I’m literally just making this up as I go I do not have a plan
Dialogue: 0,0:12:05.31,0:12:12.35,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在你可以看到这一切是如何流畅进行的，我其实就是即兴发挥的，没有一个计划
Dialogue: 1,0:12:12.35,0:12:17.98,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um maybe I could have a plan and I could try to make a puzzle that has a certain pattern or goes around the grid in a certain way
Dialogue: 0,0:12:12.35,0:12:17.98,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许我可以有个计划，我可以试着做一个有某种模式的谜题，或者以某种方式绕着网格走
Dialogue: 1,0:12:17.98,0:12:22.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like maybe I want the flow to kind of go in a circle and come into the middle that can be a nice motif
Dialogue: 0,0:12:17.98,0:12:22.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如我想让这个解谜的过程绕成一个圈，然后最后到中间来，这是一个不错的模式
Dialogue: 1,0:12:22.84,0:12:30.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's try doing that so let's make it so this one kind of goes up and gives us some logic in the upward direction
Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.84,0:12:30.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们把它做成这样，这个1能给我们一下关于上面的逻辑
Dialogue: 1,0:12:30.14,0:12:37.37,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like maybe this one and this one can combine and we can have uh let's try and think let's put a number there maybe
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.14,0:12:37.37,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许这两个可以一起，我们能…让我想想，我们也许在这里放个数字
Dialogue: 1,0:12:37.37,0:12:46.01,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe a one and maybe all three of these combine to force a light bulb uh in the upward direction there
Dialogue: 0,0:12:37.37,0:12:46.01,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许是个1，也许这三个一起就使得在上面必须有个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:12:46.01,0:12:48.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}whoops answer mode boom
Dialogue: 0,0:12:46.01,0:12:48.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}噢，点错了
Dialogue: 1,0:12:48.44,0:12:53.50,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and now this will sort of push logic horizontally
Dialogue: 0,0:12:48.44,0:12:53.50,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在我们得让逻辑链往水平方向发展
Dialogue: 1,0:12:53.50,0:12:59.96,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's see we could we could put one here maybe we could put a one here
Dialogue: 0,0:12:53.50,0:12:59.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我看看，我们可以在这里放个1
Dialogue: 1,0:12:59.96,0:13:01.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we have that one
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.96,0:13:01.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后放这个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:13:01.56,0:13:03.55,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe these two then are going to combine together
Dialogue: 0,0:13:01.56,0:13:03.55,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许这两个灯泡能一起（推出后面的结果）
Dialogue: 1,0:13:03.55,0:13:09.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}i mean we can we can reuse tricks in a new setting or we could have new tricks or we could have the same tricks
Dialogue: 0,0:13:03.55,0:13:09.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以在新的环境下复用之前的技巧，或者也可以用新的技巧
Dialogue: 1,0:13:09.56,0:13:13.47,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and all of these will take the solver on a different journey depending on what we want to do
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.56,0:13:13.47,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而所有这些都会把解谜者带入一个不同的旅程，这取决于我们想做什么
Dialogue: 1,0:13:13.47,0:13:23.39,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you know if we want to be artful and we want to have a certain sort of a plan to create something spectacular we can do that
Dialogue: 0,0:13:13.47,0:13:23.39,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果我们想要艺术性，想要按某种计划来创造一种看起来令人惊叹的东西，我们可以这样做
Dialogue: 1,0:13:23.39,0:13:29.79,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but we can also just make something flowy and simple and fast that is easy to solve and players can get through quickly
Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.39,0:13:29.79,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但我们也可以就做一些流畅的、简单的、快速的、容易解决的、玩家可以快速完成的东西
Dialogue: 1,0:13:29.79,0:13:34.14,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it all depends on what we're feeling like or what we want to do
Dialogue: 0,0:13:29.79,0:13:34.14,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这一切都取决于我们的感觉或我们想做什么
Dialogue: 1,0:13:34.14,0:13:37.60,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's see so that was the most recent one that I put in
Dialogue: 0,0:13:34.14,0:13:37.60,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们看看，这是我刚放进去的那一个
Dialogue: 1,0:13:37.60,0:13:40.99,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}I want that to force something

Dialogue: 1,0:13:54.36,0:14:01.85,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}well let's just try putting a two here and blocking off a few things maybe that
Dialogue: 0,0:13:54.36,0:14:01.85,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}好吧，让我试着在这个放个2，然后加点墙来挡住一些东西
Dialogue: 1,0:14:01.85,0:14:06.84,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so that will well do we want to have this so open I guess that's okay
Dialogue: 0,0:14:01.85,0:14:06.84,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这样就可以了，我们想要让这部分敞开吗？我想应该可以
Dialogue: 1,0:14:06.84,0:14:12.28,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh we'll force a few of these like that and then maybe we can put one like that
Dialogue: 0,0:14:06.84,0:14:12.28,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以就像这样迫使一些地方…然后也许我们可以像这样放个墙
Dialogue: 1,0:14:12.28,0:14:17.85,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we could even put a zero here which will then mean we cannot put one there
Dialogue: 0,0:14:12.28,0:14:17.85,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们甚至可以在这里放一个0，这样就意味着我们不能在放灯泡了
Dialogue: 1,0:14:17.85,0:14:24.25,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}something that's interesting sometimes is to have a long row where you can't put light bulbs anywhere on them
Dialogue: 0,0:14:17.85,0:14:24.25,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有时候这种很长一整排都不能放灯泡的情况是很有趣的
Dialogue: 1,0:14:24.25,0:14:26.49,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}for example say I put a zero here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:24.25,0:14:26.49,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如说我在这里放一个0
Dialogue: 1,0:14:26.49,0:14:32.19,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then let's see we can block this off we don't need that
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.49,0:14:32.19,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后让我看看，我们可以把这个挡住，我们不需要这个
Dialogue: 1,0:14:32.19,0:14:34.62,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but then the zero will rule out all of these
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.19,0:14:34.62,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但这个0会排除所有的这些地方
Dialogue: 1,0:14:34.62,0:14:40.25,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then if you look at this the only place this can be illuminated is by placing a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.62,0:14:40.25,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后你可以看到，唯一能照亮这个地方的就是在这里放一个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:14:40.25,0:14:46.01,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh boom and the only place where this cell can be illuminated by placing a light bulb in that cell itself boom
Dialogue: 0,0:14:40.25,0:14:46.01,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后要把这个格子照亮就得在它本身放个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:14:46.01,0:14:52.03,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe we can do this one more time
Dialogue: 0,0:14:46.01,0:14:52.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许我们可以再做一次
Dialogue: 1,0:14:52.03,0:14:56.57,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}if we put a zero here then that will rule out this
Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.03,0:14:56.57,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果我们在这里放个0，那么就可以排除这个
Dialogue: 1,0:14:56.57,0:15:00.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then the only way that cell can be illuminated is by putting a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:14:56.57,0:15:00.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后唯一可以照亮这个格子的方法就是在这里放一个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:15:00.80,0:15:05.72,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh whoops uh boom okay um
Dialogue: 0,0:15:00.80,0:15:05.72,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}噢，又点错了
Dialogue: 1,0:15:05.72,0:15:10.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}how's that working pretty good I didn't need this for anything
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.72,0:15:10.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}效果如何？很好。我不需要这个东西了
Dialogue: 1,0:15:10.08,0:15:14.88,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}maybe I want this light bulb to infer something in the middle
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.08,0:15:14.88,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许我想让这个灯泡推断出中间的一些东西来

Dialogue: 0,0:15:14.88,0:15:19.36,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我在想一个好办法来做到这个事情
Dialogue: 1,0:15:19.36,0:15:27.04,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}did we need that? maybe we could just have a two here
Dialogue: 0,0:15:19.36,0:15:27.04,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们需要这个吗？也许我们可以在这里放一个2
Dialogue: 1,0:15:27.04,0:15:31.20,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we will have to put two light bulbs there

Dialogue: 1,0:15:31.20,0:15:37.45,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then maybe this is where the final light bulb goes to eliminate that one
Dialogue: 0,0:15:31.20,0:15:37.45,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后也许这就是最后那一个灯泡的位置，来照亮那个格子
Dialogue: 1,0:15:37.45,0:15:39.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and we can check our answer
Dialogue: 0,0:15:37.45,0:15:39.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}接着我们可以检查一下我们的答案
Dialogue: 1,0:15:39.17,0:15:51.08,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}now uh you know we we erased and and re-added a bunch of things so we really should check our whole solution in order to confirm that the the logic flow is intact
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.17,0:15:51.08,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在我们应该检查一下整个解，以确认逻辑流程是完整的
Dialogue: 1,0:15:51.08,0:15:54.34,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the way to do that is erase our answer and do a complete test solve
Dialogue: 0,0:15:51.08,0:15:54.34,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}做的方法是，我们擦掉我们的答案然后做一个完整的测试过程
Dialogue: 1,0:15:54.34,0:15:56.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, let's just pretend we're solving the puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:15:54.34,0:15:56.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那么，假装我们在解这个谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:15:56.52,0:16:01.19,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you know I would do all this
Dialogue: 0,0:15:56.52,0:16:01.19,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你知道，我会做这样一些
Dialogue: 1,0:16:01.19,0:16:05.16,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}is there anything I can deduce right now there actually is I can put a light bulb here
Dialogue: 0,0:16:01.19,0:16:05.16,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有什么我现在就能推断出的吗？事实上，我可以在这里放个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:16:05.16,0:16:08.81,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because I know that this cell has to be illuminated and nothing else can light it up
Dialogue: 0,0:16:05.16,0:16:08.81,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为我知道这个格子必须被照亮，而其他地方都不行
Dialogue: 1,0:16:08.81,0:16:13.54,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you know does that spoil the aesthetic of my puzzle going all the way around
Dialogue: 0,0:16:08.81,0:16:13.54,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这会破坏我之前设计的绕整个网格一圈的逻辑流的美感吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:16:13.54,0:16:17.89,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}well maybe i might decide to fix this or I might decide I just don't care that's fine
Dialogue: 0,0:16:13.54,0:16:17.89,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}好吧，我可能会决定去修复这个问题，或者我也可能决定不管它，问题不大
Dialogue: 1,0:16:17.89,0:16:20.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but the intended first step was here
Dialogue: 0,0:16:17.89,0:16:20.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但我们设计的第一步是在这里
Dialogue: 1,0:16:20.52,0:16:23.78,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then we can get this light bulb uh
Dialogue: 0,0:16:20.52,0:16:23.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后我们可以得到这个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:16:23.78,0:16:26.92,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}sometimes it's interesting to think like what if the player doesn't see this move
Dialogue: 0,0:16:23.78,0:16:26.92,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有时候想一下如果玩家没有看到应该这样走该怎么办？这还挺有意思的
Dialogue: 1,0:16:26.98,0:16:30.69,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like what if the solver just has to go somewhere else can they make progress elsewhere
Dialogue: 0,0:16:26.98,0:16:30.69,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如说，如果解题者得从别的位置继续，那他们能在别的位置取得进展吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:16:30.69,0:16:35.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um like you might notice that you can't put two here because that would violate the one
Dialogue: 0,0:16:30.69,0:16:35.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你可能会注意到，你不能在里放两个灯泡，因为那会违反这个1
Dialogue: 1,0:16:35.56,0:16:37.86,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and we need sort of two of these three to be lit up
Dialogue: 0,0:16:35.56,0:16:37.86,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们需要在三个中的两个位置放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:16:37.86,0:16:42.09,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and therefore, this one if it wasn't lit up would force this which would be a contradiction
Dialogue: 0,0:16:37.86,0:16:42.09,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此，如果这个位置没有灯泡，那么就会迫使这里形成矛盾
Dialogue: 1,0:16:42.09,0:16:43.56,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, this one has to be lit up
Dialogue: 0,0:16:42.09,0:16:43.56,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，这里必须放灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:16:43.56,0:16:48.23,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}does that help me move forward I’m not sure I think I still need to know which one of these two it is
Dialogue: 0,0:16:43.56,0:16:48.23,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这能帮助我们取得进展吗？还不确定，我想我还是需要知道这两个里面选哪一个
Dialogue: 1,0:16:48.23,0:16:51.49,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so that would allow me to make that discovery
Dialogue: 0,0:16:48.23,0:16:51.49,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那就会让我取得这样一个发现
Dialogue: 1,0:16:51.49,0:16:53.09,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then so we get that we get that
Dialogue: 0,0:16:51.49,0:16:53.09,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后我们得到了这个，又得到了这个
Dialogue: 1,0:16:53.09,0:16:55.85,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we said that would give us this
Dialogue: 0,0:16:53.09,0:16:55.85,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这会让我们得到这个
Dialogue: 1,0:16:55.85,0:16:57.89,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which would give us this
Dialogue: 0,0:16:55.85,0:16:57.89,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}又让我们得到这个
Dialogue: 1,0:16:57.89,0:17:00.26,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and then this 2 gives us that
Dialogue: 0,0:16:57.89,0:17:00.26,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后这个2又让我们确定了这个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:00.26,0:17:02.76,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}that one gives us those two
Dialogue: 0,0:17:00.26,0:17:02.76,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}那个1又确定了这两个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:02.76,0:17:04.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which gives us that
Dialogue: 0,0:17:02.76,0:17:04.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这又让我们确定了那个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:04.17,0:17:07.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which then gives us this to sort of force that
Dialogue: 0,0:17:04.17,0:17:07.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后确定了这个，固定了那个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:07.17,0:17:10.95,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which then gives us this to force that and that's sort of just an add-on
Dialogue: 0,0:17:07.17,0:17:10.95,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这就让我们确定了这个
Dialogue: 1,0:17:10.95,0:17:15.30,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}then those two which finally reveal where that final light bulb in this row has to go
Dialogue: 0,0:17:10.95,0:17:15.30,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后是这两个，这就最终揭示了这排我们需要放置的最后那个灯泡
Dialogue: 1,0:17:15.30,0:17:16.07,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}which is there
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.30,0:17:16.07,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}就是那里
Dialogue: 1,0:17:16.07,0:17:19.27,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, most of our solution path is intact
Dialogue: 0,0:17:16.07,0:17:19.27,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，我们的解法的大部分路径都是完整的
Dialogue: 1,0:17:19.27,0:17:22.28,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}there's maybe a few places where we could skip ahead a little bit
Dialogue: 0,0:17:19.27,0:17:22.28,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}也许有几个地方我们可以跳过去一点儿
Dialogue: 1,0:17:22.28,0:17:24.71,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}do we want to go back back and fix it
Dialogue: 0,0:17:22.28,0:17:24.71,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们需要回去修复它吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:17:24.71,0:17:29.83,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}we could if we were really trying to go for a specific uh look or a specific theme
Dialogue: 0,0:17:24.71,0:17:29.83,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}我们可以这么做，如果我们真的是想追求一个特定的形式或主题的话
Dialogue: 1,0:17:29.83,0:17:33.80,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but the point is you have a lot of freedom as a puzzle designer to create that
Dialogue: 0,0:17:29.83,0:17:33.80,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但关键点还是，作为一个谜题设计师，你有很大的自由来创造这些东西
Dialogue: 1,0:17:33.80,0:17:42.57,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and this method of designing from the front or forward design allows you to really have quite tight control over the solution experience of the person solving the puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:17:33.80,0:17:42.57,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这种从正面设计的方法，或者说前向设计，可以让你对解谜者的解谜体验有严格的控制
Dialogue: 1,0:17:42.57,0:17:46.41,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh if you do it correctly and if you're good at it which is is hard right
Dialogue: 0,0:17:42.57,0:17:46.41,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}前提是你做得对或者你很擅长这一点的话。但这很难，对嘛？
Dialogue: 1,0:17:46.41,0:17:49.41,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like i've been doing this for many years so I have some experience with this
Dialogue: 0,0:17:46.41,0:17:49.41,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如说，我已经做了很多年了，所以我会有些经验
Dialogue: 1,0:17:49.41,0:17:59.46,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and you know i have a sense of like where it could go wrong or what types of assumptions i should and shouldn't make when i'm making these sort of you know when i'm adding a new square to the grid
Dialogue: 0,0:17:49.41,0:17:59.46,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}当我在网格中添加东西时，我会对哪里可能出错、我应不应该做出什么样的假设有一定的感觉
Dialogue: 1,0:17:59.46,0:18:04.13,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}how is this going to affect the solution path based on what i've created so far
Dialogue: 0,0:17:59.46,0:18:04.13,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}以及基于我目前所创造的东西，这将如何影响解谜路径？
Dialogue: 1,0:18:04.13,0:18:08.49,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and you have to have a good sense of how these puzzles solve in order to be able to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:18:04.13,0:18:08.49,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你得对这些谜题的解法有一个很好的感觉，才能做到这一点
Dialogue: 1,0:18:08.49,0:18:12.52,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so, some of the best composers of these puzzles are also the best solvers of them
Dialogue: 0,0:18:08.49,0:18:12.52,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，一些最好的谜题创作者也是最好的解谜者
Dialogue: 1,0:18:12.52,0:18:20.26,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because they themselves are able to once they place one thing in the grid they can deduce exactly all that can be deduced from it
Dialogue: 0,0:18:12.52,0:18:20.26,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为一旦他们自己在网格中添加什么东西，他们就能准确推导出所有能被推导出的东西
Dialogue: 1,0:18:20.26,0:18:24.29,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and therefore, have a really good understanding of what the solver experience is going to be
Dialogue: 0,0:18:20.26,0:18:24.29,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此他们也就对解题者的体验有很好的了解
Dialogue: 1,0:18:24.29,0:18:26.66,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um with logic puzzles that's true

Dialogue: 1,0:19:34.25,0:19:43.21,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because it's it's sort of like the soundness and completeness meeting together implying that both the existence and uniqueness of the puzzle have been established
Dialogue: 0,0:19:34.25,0:19:43.21,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为这类似于说，可靠性和完备性同时满足，就意味着谜题的存在性和独特性都被确立了
Dialogue: 1,0:19:43.21,0:19:50.12,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and that's different than a puzzle where you guess and you find the answer and you don't even know is this the unique answer is this the only answer
Dialogue: 0,0:19:43.21,0:19:50.12,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这与那种猜答案的谜题不同，那种谜题里面你找到了答案而你甚至不能确定是不是唯一的答案

Dialogue: 0,0:20:01.51,0:20:09.06,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而这就是促成这种交流的原因，因为你知道这就是谜题设计者希望你在解题时做的事情

Dialogue: 0,0:39:00.25,0:39:04.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}现在的游戏更多是关注在解谜上，关注尤里卡时刻
Dialogue: 1,0:39:04.03,0:39:07.93,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and they allow undo and reset and you can often even undo your reset
Dialogue: 0,0:39:04.03,0:39:07.93,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而且它们允许撤销和重置，你甚至可以撤销你的重置

Dialogue: 1,0:39:10.75,0:39:14.65,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}another big one is note taking and we'll get to this in the next section
Dialogue: 0,0:39:10.75,0:39:14.65,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}另一个重要的方面是做笔记，我们会在下一节中讨论这个问题
Dialogue: 1,0:39:14.65,0:39:22.91,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but essentially what I mean by note-taking is in the witness you just have to draw a line from the start to the end you can't sort of draw a partial line on the corner of the grid
Dialogue: 0,0:39:14.65,0:39:22.91,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但本质上说，在《见证者》中，你必须从头到尾画完整的一条先，你不能只画一部分的线
Dialogue: 1,0:39:22.91,0:39:32.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}whereas in alcazar the way you're making progress is by um sort of adding little bits of lines slowly until you've drawn in the whole path
Dialogue: 0,0:39:22.91,0:39:32.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而在《Alcazar》中，你是一点点加上小线段，知道你画出整条路径
Dialogue: 1,0:39:32.64,0:39:36.03,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and the experience of solving those two puzzles is very different
Dialogue: 0,0:39:32.64,0:39:36.03,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而解决这两个谜题的体验是非常不同的
Dialogue: 1,0:39:36.03,0:39:43.65,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}Note-taking can increase depth and this is you know an important enough uh lesson to be a number of its own
Dialogue: 0,0:39:36.03,0:39:43.65,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}「记笔记可以增加深度」，这一点还比较重要，值得单独列出来
Dialogue: 1,0:39:43.65,0:39:48.38,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}I want to show you an example in sudoku and then we will go back to the path drawing puzzles

Dialogue: 0,0:39:56.45,0:40:00.41,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}还有许多数独解题者同时使用这三种记法
Dialogue: 1,0:40:00.41,0:40:04.77,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}they're sort of candidate notation meaning this cell must contain one of these numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:40:00.41,0:40:04.77,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}一种是候选记号（Candidate notation），意思是格子中一定是这些数字之一
Dialogue: 1,0:40:04.77,0:40:07.71,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you know seven two means this cell is either a seven or a two
Dialogue: 0,0:40:04.77,0:40:07.71,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}写成“72”就意味着这个格子里要么是7要么是2
Dialogue: 1,0:40:07.71,0:40:12.77,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh Snyder notation is sort of the reverse it's this number goes in one of these cells
Dialogue: 0,0:40:07.71,0:40:12.77,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而Snyder记号是一种相反的记号，就是这个数字要放到这些格子中的一个位置
Dialogue: 1,0:40:12.77,0:40:16.86,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like here's a box the two in this box goes in one of these cells
Dialogue: 0,0:40:12.77,0:40:16.86,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}比如有这么个框，2就会放入这个框中的其中一格
Dialogue: 1,0:40:16.86,0:40:22.17,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and sometimes you sort of draw a two on the border between two boxes it's sometimes called a bivalue
Dialogue: 0,0:40:16.86,0:40:22.17,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}有时你会在两个框交界的地方写个2，这有时被叫做“bivalue”

Dialogue: 1,0:40:25.12,0:40:30.37,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then there are colors which means these two cells are the same number but I don't know which one they are yet
Dialogue: 0,0:40:25.12,0:40:30.37,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后还有涂色记号，意味着两个格子数字相同，但还不确定是什么数字
Dialogue: 1,0:40:30.37,0:40:36.96,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and this is an example from cracking the cryptic where here Mark Goodlife is filling out this grid
Dialogue: 0,0:40:30.37,0:40:36.96,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这里这个例子来自Cracking the Cryptic频道，Mark Goodlife正在填这个格子

Dialogue: 1,0:40:43.55,0:40:46.69,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and uh it took him 30 minutes to get this far
Dialogue: 0,0:40:43.55,0:40:46.69,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}他走到当前这个状态花了30分钟
Dialogue: 1,0:40:46.69,0:40:50.53,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but after he put in that seven he was then able to finish the whole puzzle in less than a minute
Dialogue: 0,0:40:46.69,0:40:50.53,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但当他填入7后，他就能在一分钟内完成整个谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:40:50.53,0:40:53.21,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because as soon as you get one number the whole thing collapses um
Dialogue: 0,0:40:50.53,0:40:53.21,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为一旦你得到一个数字，整个谜题就会“崩塌”
Dialogue: 1,0:40:53.21,0:40:57.50,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but this type of puzzle would not be solvable without note taking
Dialogue: 0,0:40:53.21,0:40:57.50,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但这种类型的谜题如果不做笔记的话是无法解决的
Dialogue: 1,0:40:57.50,0:41:03.65,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like you can't solve it the way you would in normal sudoku where you're just putting in one number then the next then the next then the next then the next
Dialogue: 0,0:40:57.50,0:41:03.65,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你不能像普通的数独游戏那样，先填一个数字，然后再一个接一个填
Dialogue: 1,0:41:03.65,0:41:08.89,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you need to be able to take notes and sort of reduce the possibility space down from this large you know
Dialogue: 0,0:41:03.65,0:41:08.89,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你需要做笔记，把这么大的可能性空间给缩小
Dialogue: 1,0:41:08.89,0:41:12.09,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}so many things could be the answer down to only these things could be the answer
Dialogue: 0,0:41:08.89,0:41:12.09,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}从很多东西都可以是答案，到只有这些才是答案
Dialogue: 1,0:41:12.09,0:41:15.61,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and then from there you realize ah this number has to go there
Dialogue: 0,0:41:12.09,0:41:15.61,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}然后你就会意识到，这个数字一定要放在那里
Dialogue: 1,0:41:15.61,0:41:21.05,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and so the eureka moments that are possible with note taking are much deeper than those without it
Dialogue: 0,0:41:15.61,0:41:21.05,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以，含有记笔记过程的尤里卡时刻，要比那些没有的要深刻得多
Dialogue: 1,0:41:21.05,0:41:25.60,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}let's go back to the witness this is an example from it's very early in the game
Dialogue: 0,0:41:21.05,0:41:25.60,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}让我们回到《见证者》来，这是游戏前期的一个例子
Dialogue: 1,0:41:25.60,0:41:30.78,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}in fact that you see this puzzle and there's multiple start locations multiple places where you could possibly end it
Dialogue: 0,0:41:25.60,0:41:30.78,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}事实上，你看到这个谜题之后会发现，它有多个起点和终点
Dialogue: 1,0:41:30.78,0:41:40.38,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}the goal is basically you have to draw a single line from one of those start locations to an end location that both passes through all these black hexagons
Dialogue: 0,0:41:30.78,0:41:40.38,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}目标是你必须从其中一个起点位置画一条线到终点，同时穿过所有这些黑色的六边形
Dialogue: 1,0:41:40.38,0:41:48.06,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}as well as um well it has to cut the light and dark cells uh so that they don't live in the same connected component
Dialogue: 0,0:41:40.38,0:41:48.06,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}同时还得把含有黑块和白块的格子分隔开来，使得它们在不同的连通分量当中
Dialogue: 1,0:41:48.06,0:41:59.13,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and there's a long uh you know definition of what that really is but it sort of is like keeping all the light cells on the left and dark cells on the right or vice versa it's similar to that
Dialogue: 0,0:41:48.06,0:41:59.13,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}基本上就是说让所有含黑块的格子在线一边，含有白块的格子在线的另一边
Dialogue: 1,0:41:59.13,0:42:02.97,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um and if you sort of take this puzzle into MS paint
Dialogue: 0,0:41:59.13,0:42:02.97,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而如果你把这个谜题截屏放到画图里面看
Dialogue: 1,0:42:02.97,0:42:09.44,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you could kind of draw in some little bits of deductive analysis of where the path must go
Dialogue: 0,0:42:02.97,0:42:09.44,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你就可以推理分析出一些小线段来代表路径必须经过的地方
Dialogue: 1,0:42:09.44,0:42:12.83,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and from here you can actually solve the puzzle pretty easily
Dialogue: 0,0:42:09.44,0:42:12.83,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而根据这个你可以很容易地解决这个谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:42:12.83,0:42:16.86,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}uh but that's sort of not really the way this puzzle is designed right
Dialogue: 0,0:42:12.83,0:42:16.86,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但这个谜题设计出来并不是这样的方式，对吗？
Dialogue: 1,0:42:16.86,0:42:21.60,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it's not a puzzle where you can enter partial bits of progress while playing it
Dialogue: 0,0:42:16.86,0:42:21.60,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这不是那种你玩的时候一小截一小截线段往里添加的谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:42:21.60,0:42:28.51,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it's a puzzle game where you sort of start at the beginning and then draw a line out and it goes through everything and exits
Dialogue: 0,0:42:21.60,0:42:28.51,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这是你得从起点开始画一条线、穿过所有东西直到终点的谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:42:28.51,0:42:36.64,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}this isn't necessarily a bad thing but it does limit the complexity of the types of puzzles that you could create in the witness
Dialogue: 0,0:42:28.51,0:42:36.64,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这不一定是件坏事，但它也的确限制了《见证者》中能创作的谜题的复杂性
Dialogue: 1,0:42:36.64,0:42:40.61,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like if you go back to this Alcazar puzzle on the right hand side here
Dialogue: 0,0:42:36.64,0:42:40.61,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}就比如我们回到之前那个《Alcazar》的谜题，在右手边这个
Dialogue: 1,0:42:40.61,0:42:45.09,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}you could never make this in the puzzle in the witness because it would just be too frustrating for players
Dialogue: 0,0:42:40.61,0:42:45.09,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你永远不可能在《见证者》中做这样一个谜题，因为这会让玩家非常懊恼
Dialogue: 1,0:42:45.09,0:42:53.28,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}like they would literally need to print screen it and go into paint because you can't necessarily solve it start to end without making a mistake
Dialogue: 0,0:42:45.09,0:42:53.28,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}你真的可能得截个屏然后放到画图里来看，你不可能从头到尾不犯错画根线就把它解出来了
Dialogue: 1,0:42:53.28,0:42:58.91,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um it's just sort of too much for the player's working memory to be able to do that in their head right
Dialogue: 0,0:42:53.28,0:42:58.91,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这对玩家的短期记忆能力来说实在是太多了，不可能就在脑海里完成这个任务
Dialogue: 1,0:42:58.91,0:43:01.79,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}it's too big of a grid for you to be able to head solve
Dialogue: 0,0:42:58.91,0:43:01.79,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}这个网格太大了，不可能在脑海里解出来的
Dialogue: 1,0:43:01.79,0:43:05.82,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and so, the witness fundamentally limits itself to smaller grids
Dialogue: 0,0:43:01.79,0:43:05.82,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因此，《见证者》从根本上说限制了自己只能使用较小一点的网格
Dialogue: 1,0:43:05.82,0:43:09.28,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}because it wants to you know have grids that people can head solve
Dialogue: 0,0:43:05.82,0:43:09.28,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}因为它希望它的网格能直接让人在脑海里解出来
Dialogue: 1,0:43:09.28,0:43:12.41,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}rather than grids that people are going to need to take a million notes for
Dialogue: 0,0:43:09.28,0:43:12.41,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而不是需要人们去做无数的笔记
Dialogue: 1,0:43:12.41,0:43:16.83,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}but that sort of limits how deep and interesting those puzzles can be
Dialogue: 0,0:43:12.41,0:43:16.83,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但这同时也限制那些谜题的深度和趣味性
Dialogue: 1,0:43:16.83,0:43:20.29,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}now that said taking notes isn't necessarily a good fit for the theme of the witness
Dialogue: 0,0:43:16.83,0:43:20.29,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}虽然这么说，但做笔记本身不一定适合《见证者》的主题
Dialogue: 1,0:43:20.29,0:43:24.45,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}the witness is fundamentally a game about drawing a line from one place to the next
Dialogue: 0,0:43:20.29,0:43:24.45,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}《见证者》从根本上说就是从一点到另一点画线的游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:43:24.45,0:43:28.35,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}and not a game about note-taking when you're solving logic puzzles
Dialogue: 0,0:43:24.45,0:43:28.35,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而不是要求边解逻辑谜题边做笔记的游戏
Dialogue: 1,0:43:28.35,0:43:32.38,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um so I think the witnesses approach is correct for what the witness is trying to do
Dialogue: 0,0:43:28.35,0:43:32.38,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}所以我认为《见证者》的方法对于《见证者》本身所要尝试做的事情来说，是正确的
Dialogue: 1,0:43:32.38,0:43:37.63,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}um but I’m just saying it does create some limitation in what types of puzzles can be expressed
Dialogue: 0,0:43:32.38,0:43:37.63,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}但我还是得说它对能够表达的谜题类型产生了一些限制
Dialogue: 1,0:43:37.63,0:43:42.05,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}or you know can be expressed in a way that's convenient for the solver to access
Dialogue: 0,0:43:37.63,0:43:42.05,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}或者说（它限制了）那种能够用让玩家可以方便解出来的方式表达的
Dialogue: 1,0:43:42.05,0:43:50.94,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}without copy pasting the puzzle into MS paint or taking notes on paper or trying to keep way too many things in their head at once
Dialogue: 0,0:43:42.05,0:43:50.94,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而不需要把谜题粘贴到画图中，或者在纸上做笔记，或者在脑海中记太多东西的谜题
Dialogue: 1,0:43:51.01,0:43:57.66,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}some puzzles are basically designed such that note taking is the solution to the puzzle
Dialogue: 0,0:43:51.01,0:43:57.66,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}而有些谜题基本上就是把记笔记作为谜题的解决步骤
Dialogue: 1,0:43:57.66,0:43:59.13,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}minesweeper is one of them
Dialogue: 0,0:43:57.66,0:43:59.13,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}扫雷就是其中之一
Dialogue: 1,0:43:59.13,0:44:03.23,Eng,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}if you try solving minesweeper without noting the mines it's really hard
Dialogue: 0,0:43:59.13,0:44:03.23,Chi,,0,0,0,,{\fad(120,120)}如果你试着不标记地雷的位置来解开扫雷，那真的很困难
