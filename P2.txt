Hi welcome back to part two of my extended director's cut of my GDC talk on 30 puzzle design lessons from classic puzzle communities and how those lessons can be applied to the creation of video game puzzles
大家好，欢迎回到我的GDC演讲"来自经典谜题社区的30节谜题设计课，以及如何将这些经验应用到视频游戏谜题的创作中"的第二部分
The 11th lesson is "create a rewarding ending" 
第11节课是「创造一个有收获的结局」
and the quintessential example of this is the puzzle Picross aka Nanograms
这方面最典型的例子是Picross，也就是"数织"
（译者注：Nanogram数织游戏，在一个空白网格中，每行每列前面都标注有该行或该列中连续相邻黑格的长度，玩家据此来涂色）
which the Picross games have been published by Nintendo since the 90s 
任天堂从90年代开始发行Picross游戏
and I think the first nanograms were published in the late 80s in various Japanese puzzle magazines.
而我认为第一个数织游戏是在80年代末发表在各种日本解谜杂志上的
There's an interesting story about the origin of them.
关于它的起源有一个有趣的故事
They were created by two different authors seemingly simultaneously, 
数织是由两个不同作者独立创造的
（译者注：即由 西尾徹也 和 いしだのん 二人独立创作的）
but alas one of the exciting things about nanograms is at the end you sort of get this picture 
数织游戏令人兴奋的一点是，在最后你会得到这样的图案
and there's always this question like what is the picture gonna be,
（在解的过程中）总会产生比如"这个图案会是什么呢？"的问题
anticipation for uh sort of that exciting moment 
对那个激动人心的时刻有一种期盼
where the picture or the identity of the picture, What is it? Oh, it's a rubber duck! It's a lion! It’s finally revealed.
这个图案或图案代表的是什么呢？哦，是一只橡皮鸭！是一只狮子！最终终于被揭开了
Another example is this puzzle Spiral Galaxies which it doesn't have an ending surprise step at the end 
另一个例子是"螺旋星系"谜题，它本身是没有一个惊喜的结尾的
but a variant of it does and I will show you the classic first
但它的一个变体却有，我先给你们看经典版本
So, this is the classic spiral galaxies. 
这就是经典版本的螺旋星系
The goal is to partition the grid into these regions, 
游戏目标是将网格划分为一些区域
each of which contains exactly one dot and the shape of the region is rotationally symmetric 180 degrees around that dot.
每个区域正好包含一个点，而且每个区域围绕那个点中心对称
It's a very interesting puzzle.
这是一个非常有趣的谜题
There's a lot of fascinating logic that goes into solving them.
深入研究的话就会有很多迷人的逻辑
But another similar type of puzzle which is printed by Nikoli under the name "Tentai Show" 
不过有一种类似的谜题，是Nikoli以"Tentaishou"的名字刊发的
which is a hilarious pun if you know Japanese.
如果你懂日语的话，（" Tentaishou"）这个名字还是个滑稽的双关
"taishou" means symmetry and ten means symmetry about a point 
「点」(ten)是点的意思，「対称」(taishou）是对称的意思，合起来就是点对称
but "tentai" also means sort of a heavenly body like a galaxy, so, this is a show of heavenly bodies.
但「天体」(tentai)又是天体的意思，所以，这又是"天体show"
Excellent pun.
很棒的双关
Anyways digression 
无论如何，有点跑题了
this was first published in Nikoli magazine in 2001 by an author who goes by Gesaku 
这个在2001年首次发表在Nikoli杂志上的作品，作者叫Gesaku
and it's essentially a spiral galaxy's puzzle where some of the dots are dark colored 
它本质上还是一个螺旋星系谜题，不过其中一些点是涂黑了的
and if you shade the dark colored dots, you get a shape 
如果你把黑点对应的区域上色的话，就会得到一个形状
and here's a more sophisticated example quite a large instance 
这里有一个更复杂的例子，相当大的一个例子
when you solve it, you get this and the shape is that of an astronaut 
当你解出来的时候，你会得到一个宇航员的图形
uh quite an interesting uh composition that's been put together
非常有趣的构图
and you might ask well is the puzzle boring because of this 
你可能会问，这样做了之后谜题会不会变得无聊？
does this sort of compromise the flow of the puzzle because you're having to make all of these regions fit together in exactly this way
这是否会牺牲解谜过程，因为必须得让这些区域按图形这种方式组合在一起
and the answer is mostly not 
答案是大部分不会
like if you look over to the left side of this puzzle, you can kind of see there's really elaborate snaking and winding regions going all over the place 
如果你看一下这个谜题的左边，你可以看到有一些精心设计的蜿蜒曲折的区域
and those are quite interesting to solve and to sort of figure out the logic of how that must be shaped
这些解起来都很有趣，而且弄清楚形状形成的逻辑也很有趣
however, putting those in sort of requires large amounts of just one color of region 
然而，把这些形状融入进去就会让很多区域是同一种颜色
and that can sort of force the design 
这可能会影响到设计
if you wanted to make a qr code into this then probably most of the puzzle would be relatively uninteresting to solve
如果你想弄成个二维码图案的谜题，那么谜题大部分解起来就会相对无趣了
it relies or depends heavily on uh the shape being a certain way 
这在很大程度上依赖于形状本身
here's an example that kind of illustrates that 
这里有一个例子可以说明这一点
this is you know I’m just putting this together to show off its GDC 2021
这个是我做的一个展现出GDC2021的图案
but this is actually made using a text generator by Erik Demaine and Martin Demaine 
我这个实际上是用Erik Demaine和Martin Demaine的文本生成器来生成的
（译者注：用文本生成Tentai Show谜题的生成器在：https://erikdemaine.org/fonts/spiralgalaxies/）
and it shows you know you can do whatever you want with these Tentai Show puzzles 
这个就表面了你可以用任何图案来制作Tentai Show谜题
but like you know this is the 2 and it's just a diagonal set of one by one things 
但你看这是个2，它只是一个一个点斜着摆放而已
it's not particularly interesting or solve or fun to solve
这个解起来并不是特别有趣
another example of putting a surprise at the end of the puzzle 
另一个在谜题结尾加入惊喜的例子是
are the extraction steps that occur in puzzle hunts like the MIT mystery hunt
在解谜寻宝比赛中的"提炼步骤"，比如MIT解谜寻宝比赛
where every single puzzle has a solution that is a word or a phrase and often those are used in metapuzzles or other things
在那里面每道谜题的答案都是一个单词或短语，而这些答案又经常被用于"元谜题"(metapuzzle)或其他一些东西里面
（译者注：元谜题 meta puzzle，几个谜题的答案本身又组成一个新的谜题）
here's a Tentai show puzzle whose answer is actually a five letter word
这里有一道Tentai Show谜题，它的答案是一个五个字母的单词
and if you solve it, you get this and maybe you can guess what the five letter word answer is 
如果你解开它，你会得到这样一个图案，那么你也许能猜出这个答案是什么
of course, it is clubs 
当然，答案是"梅花" ♣
this is by Pavel Curtis from his blog Adalogical Ænigmas 
这个谜题是来自Pavel Curtis的博客Adalogical Ænigmas
（译者注：pavelspuzzles.com/aenigmas/）
which has a lot of interesting puzzles that have a word or phrase as an answer
他有很多用一个单词或短语作为答案的有趣的谜题
the extraction steps have a couple of values
"提炼步骤"有几个方面的价值
they provide this additional final eureka moment which can be especially exciting if you're anticipating it or there's a little bit of a surprise at the end
它们提供了最后这样一个额外的尤里卡时刻，如果你期待它出现的话，那么它会非常地令人兴奋
they also exploit the peak end rule which means uh well the the things that people tend to remember the most are are sort of the the peak or the most salient part of an experience as well as the ending or the last thing
它们还利用了「峰终定律(Peak-End Rule)」：人们倾向于记住一段体验中的高峰或最突出的部分，以及结尾部分
and so, if the last part of an experience is somehow exciting or memorable
因此，如果一个体验的结尾部分是令人激动或难忘的话， 
then overall the experience will be viewed more positively
那么总体来说，这个体验会被更加积极地看待
and so that's true of puzzles like these 
而谜题也是如此
it also can create setups for metapuzzles where words like clubs can be used as ingredients in another puzzle 
它还能为元谜题创造条件，像"梅花"这样的单词可以被用作另一个谜题的成分
and many uh puzzle hunts like MIT mystery hunter set up with these meta puzzles that are sort of like boss puzzles 
而许多解谜寻宝比赛，比如MIT解谜寻宝比赛，会设置这样的元谜题来作为类似说最后的Boss谜题
where there might be 12 other puzzles you need to solve and then you take those 12 words and you use them to solve this final puzzle 
你可能得先解决另外12个谜题，然后拿着这12个单词来解决这最后的谜题
and maybe only eight to ten of those twelve are actually needed
或者也许实际上只需要其中8到10个单词
so, uh it can create a sort of progression gate where you don't necessarily need to solve everything but you need to solve most of it
所以这样可以创造一种阶段性门槛，你不一定得解决全部谜题，可能解决其中大部分就行了
um and that can be very useful for uh pacing and structuring a puzzle hunt
这对于设置解谜寻宝比赛的节奏和步骤非常有用


lesson number 12 is to embed secrets and surprises
第12课是「藏入一些秘密和惊喜」
and this is sort of another way of cramming more eureka moments into the same puzzle
这算是向同一道谜题中塞入更多尤里卡时刻的另一种方式
I’ll show you one example from cryptic crosswords 
我给你看一个Cryptic Crossword的例子
（译者注：Cryptic Crossword是一种在英国特别流行的填字游戏，其中每个词的线索都是一个字谜）
these things are called Ninas and they are sort of little easter eggs hidden in a puzzle 
这种东西被称作「Nina」，它们算是藏在谜题中的小彩蛋
in this puzzle if you read the words going around the outside or the letters it will say 
在这道谜题中，如果你把沿着外框周围的字母按顺序读出来就是：
"Monty Python’s Flying Circus" , sort of going sequentially around the border of the puzzle
"Monty Python’s Flying Circus"（《巨蟒剧团之飞翔的马戏团》）
and this is known as a Nina 
这就是所谓的 "Nina"
the name Nina comes from Al Hirschfeld who's a uh he was a comic author in the US 
"Nina"这个叫法来自Al Hirschfeld，他是美国的一位漫画家
and Nina is the name of his daughter 
Nina是他女儿的名字
and here you can see the word Nina is actually hidden in the hair of this character three separate times 
在这里你可以看到"Nina"这个词实际上是藏在这个人物的头发里的，有三个地方
you can see the N-I-N-A
你可以看到N-I-N-A的字母
and he signs his name with a little 3 next to it indicating that there are three Ninas hidden in this one particular comic
他在署名的时候在旁边加了个小的数字3，表面这个漫画中藏了3个"Nina"
and he did this throughout his career after his daughter was born
在他整个职业生涯中，自从他女儿出生之后他都是如此做的
and so Ninas are essentially the untracked secrets or easter eggs of UK crosswords 
所以"Nina"本质上是英国填字游戏中隐藏着的秘密或者说彩蛋
and one feature of them that's very notable is that they are missable 
它们的一个显著特点是，它们是"可错过的"
you could go through this entire crossword solve the whole thing think you were done and not even realize there was something there
你可能把整个填字游戏解出来了，觉得自己做完了，甚至都没有意识到那你还有什么东西
uh is this a problem or is it a feature
那这算是个缺点还是特性呢？
uh well I mean one issue with it being missable is sort of that eureka moment is just not going to be experienced by the whole audience of this puzzle 
这种"可错过的"东西所带来的一个问题是，它对应的尤里卡时刻是没法被所有玩家都体验到的
but on the other hand, the fact that the secret is missable somehow makes it more valuable
但另一方面，这个秘密是"可错过的"这一点，在某种程度上又使它本身更有价值
it creates uh this feeling whenever you're solving one of these this author's puzzles let's say that there might just always be something lurking around the corner
它创造了这样一种感觉，每当你在做这个作者的谜题的时候，总会觉得在角落里会藏着什么东西
and when you do find it it's more of a surprise 
而当你找到它的时候就会有更多的惊喜
and as we learned earlier that the sort of more surprising or unexpected something is the more exciting it is the more dopaminergic it is the the more sparkle is there 
而正如我们前面所学到的，越是令人惊讶或意外的东西，就越令人兴奋、有越高多巴胺能、有更多Sparkle
so, the fact that the secrets are missable provides uh sort of additional excitement when you do find it
所以，秘密是可错过的这一点会让你在解开它的时候有额外的兴奋
um another thing that missable secrets can do especially in video games is they can provide a reason to sort of go back to an old game
可错过的秘密能做到的另一件事是，特别是在电子游戏中，它能提供一个回去玩老游戏的原因
uh like if I go back to a game like Chrono Trigger which is an RPG from the 90s
比如我回去玩《超时空之轮》这样的90年代的RPG
uh there are things you can discover in that game that you didn't discover when you played it the first time 
你会发现一些你第一次玩的时候没发现的东西
whether it's a line of dialogue or it's a sort of a hidden item that you just never knew was there
不论是一段对话或者某个隐藏物品，你之前不知道它的存在
there are so many things and so much depth in a good rpg that you can play it multiple times
一个好的RPG里面有很多东西、很多深度，你可以反反复复玩
and I think some puzzle games like the Witness are starting to incorporate more and more of this into their games as well which is great
我觉得一些解谜游戏，如《见证者》，也开始在里面融入更多这样的东西，这一点很不错


um lesson number 13 aporia is a promise

of surprise

aporia is a statement when you're

solving a puzzle

where you as a solver believe that the

puzzle is impossible you may even feel

like you have a proof that it's

impossible

i need to do this but there's a catch i

just can't

what's the trick um this may also be

called a known unknown where

you as a solver know that there is

something that you don't know

you think that ah well i mean this this

puzzle is in this game or this person

has

you know built and shipped this puzzle

to me which i have in my hands it must

have a solution and yet

i convinced myself that i i believe it

has no solution

uh an example a simple example is with

this puzzle here

uh that i created uh i'll show you how

it works

uh let's switch to the full cam um

this object right here we'll call the

cage and there are two other parts which

i will call a and b

here's a it's sort of got the l-shaped

tetris piece connected to the s-shape

and this is b b sort of has this

three-way junction up near the top

and the goal is to sort of put a and b

into the cage

and well let's let's just slide a in you

can kind of put it in like that

and that's the only place it goes it's

very easy to see that and then you try

and put b

in and it just like it won't fit there's

not enough room to slide it in

uh you could try putting it in from the

bottom it there's no room to put it in

there either

okay well maybe you don't put a in first

maybe you have to put b

in first and uh you can try that you

know here's

here's b in i'll just slide it down

there

uh but then you have to put a and you

can kind of see where it goes

right like it's kind of kind of wrap

around there and slide in there but you

just

you can't slide it in there's no way to

make it work

so it's not a before b and it's not b

before a well then it must be impossible

right

but no actually the solution is you take

b and you put it in kind of halfway

and you stick it up there and then you

can kind of just put a in half way and

slide it in the back

and then b comes down

and

there we go and then it's solved uh so

you know the trick is you have to put a

in halfway

um back to the presentation

uh so i mean and this isn't a difficult

puzzle this might be a level one or a

level two puzzle it's not particularly

challenging but it illustrates the point

of

the obvious things lead to a

non-solution to the puzzle and you might

even be convinced like well then this

puzzle's impossible you can't put a in

first you can't put b in first so

clearly it's a possible well okay but

there was something

that you didn't notice the state of

aporia this state of feeling like the

puzzle is impossible or simultaneously

believing both

that well i think it's impossible but

yet the puzzle is in front of me and a

solution has been promised

um it creates this uh idea that an

interesting

trick exists it sort of promises you

that a powerful eureka moment is coming

and primes you for the discovery of

something really cool

and that mystery and anticipation is

really motivating

like there's a big reveal coming and you

can now anticipate it and the sort of

state of anticipating a reward or

anticipating a eureka moment

is it can be more motivating and more

dopaminergic than actually getting the

reward

um and so this state of aporia is highly

motivating and

when a player is convinced that they're

just on the cusp of a really cool

discovery

that could be a time where they're very

unlikely to quit and very likely to

remember and uh you know want to share

that discovery once they found it

and be very excited by it so aporia is a

great trick

i will show you an example this is from

a game called pipe push paradise by

corey martin a few years back

this is a puzzle where you sort of have

to push these pipes around and in this

puzzle

in particular on the left here you have

this pipe with water flowing out and you

have to connect it to the one on the

right

and you might realize well okay so you

just have to make this u shape with

these two pieces you can sort of flip

and rotate the pieces around

the problem is that when you get to this

state you can't leave the puzzle

and you have to both connect the pipes

up and have a way of exiting in this

case the exit is at the bottom but you

just can't get down there

and uh you know once you've played with

this puzzle a bit you can realize that

there's no way to be

at the puzzle at the bottom of this

puzzle while also having the pipes in

this configuration there's just no last

move that could have created this

configuration and leave you at the

bottom

you could never have pushed those pipes

up into that configuration because

there wouldn't have been a place for you

to stand um

and one of the things that you'll

observe if you're playing around with

this puzzle enough is that you can

actually rotate the pipes

into a different configuration where

they're out in three dimensions this is

a three-dimensional puzzle solving game

where

the rotations sometimes take things up

off of the floor

and this prompts you to find the real

solution which is actually to make the

archway

in the third dimension such that you can

walk under it and leave the puzzle

and this is a very memorable solution

but the thing that sort of primes you

for this surprise is

going back to your first attempt at the

solution and realizing this ain't gonna

work

and perhaps even being so puzzled by it

that you might leave the puzzle go try

something else and then come back once

you've realized that

well all the other puzzles had solutions

this one must have one but what am i not

thinking of and that final surprise is

just so memorable

both because it's an exciting surprise

but also because

of the fact that you couldn't solve it

any other means

now in order to make this work you have

to do this which is uh

our 14th lesson cultivate the trust of

the solver

and one example of where this comes up

is say you're on the puzzle subreddit or

the puzzling stack exchange and you just

click on a random interesting puzzle

and it looks cool but you play around

with it a bit and it looks impossible

and maybe you've even convinced yourself

that it must be impossible you have a

proof that it's impossible

maybe there's a really cool eureka

moment lurking beneath the service the

surface that you just didn't discover

yet

but on the other hand maybe just there's

a rule missing there's a piece

missing maybe the person who made this

puzzle screwed up or maybe the puzzle

uh the poster of the puzzle screwed up

and just forgot to include

something maybe it's intended to be

impossible maybe it's you know one of

these famous

koenigsberg bridge style puzzles that

literally has no solution and

discovering why

is is sort of the interesting part of it

and i've literally seen all of the above

on these websites

uh but if it's from a source that i

trust or it has a lot of

upvotes then maybe it's worth pursuing

anyway you know but

uh the ability for me to trust that this

puzzle is actually something interesting

is often limited if it's just you know a

random post on a random website from

somebody i don't know and i'm

i might give up on it before i i

actually push

forward and find that interesting eureka

moment

this happens a lot in video games

especially action adventure games in

metroidvania

let's say you you see an interesting

puzzle you know there's this heart piece

being teased over here in the corner in

zelda

uh can i get it right now maybe i'm

missing an item maybe i have to come

back once i find the hook shot or the

glider or whatever maybe there's an

ability i don't have

maybe the world itself will change maybe

you know in act three they'll be moving

platforms and mushroom sprouting here

that i could jump on

maybe when i become adult link instead

of child link i'll be able to jump that

far maybe the game has a bug

this has happened to me so many times

where i play an indie puzzle game the

first week it comes out and it just

hasn't had a patch yet

and there's some kind of issue with one

of the puzzles

where i you know i just can't solve it

and the problem with that is

once that happens to you once you no

longer have

any trust in the the rest of the game

like every time you get stuck on a

puzzle you might just think well what if

the game's bugged again

right uh it puts you in a state where

you're no longer sort of following that

drip feed of like oh i'm just on the

cusp of something exciting i just need

to push forward a little bit

instead there's this sort of unhealthy

skepticism that robs you of that

motivating force to continue going in

this case for this zelda puzzle it turns

out you can get it at this stage of the

game you just have to go grab a chicken

and you have to carry the chicken up

quite a ways but then you can sort of

use it to sail over there because when

you're holding the chicken you fall much

less slowly and so it in fact does have

a solution but that may not be obvious

to you until much later in the game

uh a way of dealing with this that

superland used

was to actually have npcs that tell you

you have everything you need to solve

this puzzle

go for it uh and this happens at

multiple times in the game in some cases

you'll even

reach an area where you can no longer go

back like you have to fall

off something and it locks you in a room

with an npc says you

says you could solve this puzzle right

now and then you just have to do it

and superland is a metroidvania where

you're constantly getting new items that

add new abilities or affordances to the

player and so you might often come to a

puzzle that you can't solve and say well

maybe i just have to come back once i

get an item

and so if that were the case for every

puzzle in the game then the

for the puzzles that gate your

progression you know the player might

just turn around and go do something

else

and so something like this is in fact

necessary to sort of tell the player no

no you need to push forward on this one

puzzle

even though it's hard you can do it um

and superland was a very highly reviewed

game it was 96

positive on steam it was one of my

favorite puzzle games of this whole year

um but you know many people might think

this is breaking the fourth wall it's a

little bit distasteful there's some kind

of dissonance going on here between the

character and the player and what's

what's happening and david munich is a

very experienced puzzle creator he was

the the creator of the original not

prawn which was

the most famous internet riddle of sort

of the the flash internet era back in

the early to

mid 2000s and so

he's been creating puzzles for a long

time and understands very well the

experience that a solver goes through

when they're solving a puzzle and he

felt it was necessary to do this because

he wanted to preserve the sanctity of

the player's trust that the puzzle

itself is solvable

while also making a metroidvania where

you're getting new items all the time

that do new things

so an interesting solution to the

problem

a related idea is that of square dealing

which uh

it's a term that i've seen in in

crossword communities and other puzzle

communities but it basically refers to

the

conventions that the constructors of

puzzles are abiding by

to play fair um and you'll see many of

these conventions for example in puzzle

hunts

they will never have anagrams without a

clue and the reason is because when

you're doing a puzzle hunt puzzle these

are typically puzzles where the rules

are not provided

and you have to figure out what it is

that you need to do you might literally

try anagraming everything you could dump

every word in this puzzle the title of

every puzzle whatever into anagram

generators and just come up with nothing

or come up with something that's maybe

tenuously there but turns out to be

nothing

and that experience as a solver is not a

pleasant experience so to

you know save the solver from having to

do that the uh

the authors of puzzle hunt puzzles will

just tell you right up front there are

no

uncled anagrams in this puzzle hunt and

that will be part of the rules that are

communicated to the player

um cryptic crosswords have a similar

convention where they don't do indirect

anagrams which is basically like

uh you know if there's an anagram it has

to be clued by a trigger word and it

can't be

mixed with another type of hint escape

rooms have some conventions like one key

one lock if you get a four-digit code

you're never gonna have to put it in

multiple different

four-digit combination locks because

again that would just be irritating are

you do you want the player to have to

retry everything over and over again no

so one key one lock is sort of a

convention that saves the sanity of some

players

now whether or not this is advertised or

told to the players before they begin

it's

you know it's kind of 50 50 it depends

on which escape room you're doing

uh no outside knowledge is another

common convention

but it's it's sort of like if you're a

solver of cryptics you probably realize

this no indirect anagrams rule

even if it's just subconsciously because

you just never see it right you just

realize that oh well they wouldn't print

that

i don't have to do that but beginners

may not understand this and may never

even really

have learned it unless somebody taught

them so beginners can spend a lot of

time on

cryptics just trying stuff that is never

possibly necessary because they don't

understand the conventions of the genre

right so square dealing is important but

in video games especially it's also

important to communicate those rules to

the player

because every puzzle game you play will

have different rules about how the

puzzles are designed and what's allowed

and what's not

and sometimes it's not that explicit

some games actually tell the player and

this is a game called it'll do which is

sort of a zelda-like

and after you exit the first dungeon it

literally tells you there's no

missable items or chests in dungeons at

all

and not every zelda-like has these types

of conventions and in classic zelda's

usually the convention is there's no

need to return to dungeons later

meaning that every item that you could

get in a dungeon is one that you could

get with sort of the the key or

progression items from that dungeon

and earlier or and the prerequisites

although that's not true in every zelda

and it's not true

in uh every dungeon of every zelda

so um having that type of square dealing

is useful and communicating it to the

player can really help build that

trusting relationship

that allows the player to sort of press

on when they're stuck on a puzzle

the sort of contra positive to that is

avoid cheap tricks

i'm going to pick on the talos principle

when it released

it had a puzzle where well this isn't

one of the main puzzles in the game it's

actually one of the

bonus puzzles that you have to get stars

for but one of the stars and it's very

early on in the game it's in the the

first uh first major area of the fourth

world of that

uh there is a hidden reflector up in a

tree that you have to aim a laser at

and uh up until this point in the game

all the reflectors are just items on the

ground you can pick them up and move

them this one is stationary and it's in

a tree and in no other part of the game

do you ever have to look up in the tree

for anything

and there are so many other things that

you can try to solve this puzzle that

almost barely work

i literally wasted i don't know more

than an hour trying to get this thing

and then to learn that the answer was

well it was in a tree

uh that was kind of upsetting

but also it made me distrust the

developer because for every other puzzle

in that game instead of pressing on when

i was stuck i just had this thought well

what if it's some more like

that

reflector in the tree um it turns out

that

after the game launched they actually

patched it and they changed that

reflector in the tree to a

reflector on a very prominent salient

pillar that you could see from all

directions

uh that made it clear that there was a

reflector up there and then it became a

mystery of

what's that reflector on the pillar for

turns out one of the secret bonus stars

and this is sort of a much more honest

way of of designing this puzzle and it

prevents

that player's mind from being poisoned

by well am i going to have to look in a

tree

forever i'm going to

uh quote my good friend weihua who said

a good puzzle has an aha moment a bad

puzzle has an

oh really moment um hue has a four-time

world puzzle champion and he's

he's been published uh everywhere he's

done crosswords for new york times he's

done world puzzle championship stuff

he's

a game designer as well and done

physical puzzles uh

this guy is one of the most experienced

puzzle creators i know

and for him you know this oh really

moment this discovery of like

it was that all along is uh

a very negative experience when you're

expecting or hoping

instead for an exciting eureka um

bob bates refers to that as poisoning of

the well bob bates designed a lot of uh

adventure games point-and-click games

for infocom and legend entertainment

in the late 80s and 90s and bob actually

gave a gdc talk where he sort of

emphasized that a good understanding of

puzzle design theory was necessary to

avoid

this pitfall of creating a state in

players where

there's sort of this unhealthy

skepticism that the designers aren't

playing fair

uh and here you know here's just a

general list of things to avoid

um anything that requires you to do lots

of searching without a clue

darkness is a big one if there are dark

corners of your game and literally the

player has to walk into every one of

them or even

walk into every one of them and jump in

order to find that hidden nook where you

might have hidden something

that's that can be irritating wall

pressing if if the player has to touch

every wall shoot every wall

press the action box on every wall um if

there are invisible platforms the player

can't see them and they just have to

jump randomly to see where there might

be an invisible platform

those types of experiences can be very

draining for players because

uh instead of feeling like they're on

the right track they're feeling like

they're just sort of laboriously

searching the entire possible game for

the thing you might have hidden if they

want to sort of complete the puzzles

so you never want to do this and the

other thing that can happen is like

say you had a clue which illustrated oh

well you're going to have to jump in the

dark

maybe the player didn't see that clue

and they just happened to wander that

way and find it

the problem is if the player comes out

and realized well there was no clue i

guess i have to check every dark zone

anywhere

um that is sort of an equal well

poisoning

right so you not just have to make sure

you put the clue you have to make sure

that the player can't get there without

the clue you have to make sure the clue

is somehow

sort of obvious or at least the you know

maybe when the players coming back out

they will then see the clue you know a

way to avoid that

you don't want to have puzzles that

suddenly increase tenuousness

like force the player to do something

they never had to do force the player to

look outside the game when they never

had to look outside the game

uh you know some kind of new trick or

method that is suddenly used or required

especially if it's a one-off if you only

have to use it once well will the player

now be paranoid that they have to use it

again will they try it on every other

puzzle in the rest of the game

you want to make sure that you don't

have that situation

inconsistency in general if the rules

are changing

then players will never know whether

they can expect

their understanding of the game their

conceptual model for how the game

systems work to be correct if they're

questioning the conceptual model

then they're not in a good space to do

problem solving right you want players

to feel that they rock solid

understand the game's rules the game's

logic and are then solving things

rather than questioning that at least if

you're making a game that's about

logic or about understanding rules there

are some games that are just not about

that and that's okay

there are some games that are just about

rule discovery but that brings us to

point number 15 which is be careful with

in

transparencies and in transparency of a

puzzle is any aspect that is not

explained to the solver a hidden rule a

hidden goal

maybe a hidden affordance meaning a

hidden thing that the player can do

or a hidden interaction or hidden

consequence of a certain interaction

in transparencies can also come in the

form of the inability to perceive or

interpret

the state of the puzzle essentially if

you're familiar with the the quote

unquote seven stages of action

uh which uh i think uh don norman was

the one who who initially uh made that a

popular idea

any one of those seven stages of action

can have a failure

where where due to in transparency the

person trying to perform an action just

doesn't understand something

right um i will show you an example this

is a puzzle

i have it right here it's called the

remove octahedron

and this puzzle is a puzzle that you

your goal is to try and disassemble

it uh and sort of get into it and you

can kind of like move

one of the parts around but you know

most of them

don't really move and if you listen

carefully

you can hear that there's something

going on in the inside of it but you

can't see what it is

right so this is an example of an in

transparency in a puzzle

um another example would be

instructionless puzzles

um this puzzle on the left is uh from a

round of the german

national puzzle championship which is

how they select their team for world

puzzle championships

and they had an instructionless round

and how it works is

you're given an empty sort of input

puzzle and then you're given its

solution

and your goal is to work out what is the

rule where this input could lead to this

solution and

it's unique there is no other solution

to this puzzle

and sometimes that uniqueness is an

important part of discovering what the

rules are

and then of course they'll give you an

actual contest puzzle that you have to

solve and

all of this including both discovering

the instructions and solving the puzzle

you're doing under time pressure in this

case the rule is that

the number tells you of its four

cardinal neighbors in the north south

east west direction

how many of them are different or how

many different numbers are represented

there

so a one uh you know this one has two

threes next to it it only has one

unique neighbor whereas this four has

all four of one two three four as its

neighbors

another example is this game understand

which is a steam game where they give

you a bunch of symbols on the grid and

you have to

figure out the rules the witness also

has

this instructionlessness as a part of

sort of the early phase of the game when

you're learning what the rules are

rather than the later phase of the game

where you're solving puzzles using those

known rules

uh mystery hunt puzzles are basically

all

instruction lists they tend to give you

some input and then find something to

solve this is one from this year's

mystery hunt where the

input was a picture of a bunch of

diagrams

of what look like sound devices or

digital synthesizers and you get a bunch

of these and then you also get these

like

random strings of letters some of which

are red colored

and it turns out that you have to

download this software that sort of

allows you to put together eurorack

style modular synths

and put them together this way and they

would all make

synth noises from popular songs uh you

know like

a synth from lady gaga or from

eurythmics or from whatever

and then these things on the right

corresponded to the melodies that you

had to play and then you had to put the

melodies together and

get a secret message from that and then

there was a whole second part to it

um but the point is that the rules are

not given at all

and figuring out the rules figuring out

what you have to do and getting that aha

moment of oh these are songs i have to

play them that is part of the magic of

mit mystery hunt

is discovering what it is that you have

to do and in transparencies can be a

huge amount of fun

but there are many caveats they can

cause solvers to become stuck and

i've heard this called enigma syndrome

or a few other things where you

literally just don't know what to do

because you failed to put two and two

together

and that tends to be an unfun kind of

stuck for many puzzles because you don't

necessarily have different approaches or

different things to try there isn't

really a recourse for you if you just

can't

figure out what you need to do if you're

making a linear story based game where

the puzzles have to come in sequence

then getting stuck means blocking

progression in the game which literally

means the player cannot play anymore

unless they either look up the solution

or

or cheat or they just have to quit and

come back tomorrow

and some players you know they really

don't want to look up the solution right

but if they're gonna be uh you know very

devout about that

then they just can't play the game

anymore right they literally may just

stop there and never play beyond that

um you can see with the completion

statistics of many puzzle games on steam

especially

if they have achievements you can see

well oh everybody quit after this

achievement because there was a really

hard puzzle there that got stuck

on the other hand if you're making a

linear game and you want to avoid that

you may end up

taking every puzzle that is remotely

difficult and kind of standing off the

difficulty or adding hints and those may

make it a less

pleasurable experience for some other

players that really want the challenge

right so you're

you're having to balance all of these

goals together if you make a linear game

another common complaint is that these

in transparencies can feel like an iq

test it feels like oh i just have to

figure out what the pattern is and some

players don't want that to be their

puzzle solving experience

the resolution of the in transparency is

also a one-time reveal you can't make a

hundred puzzles that are based on one in

transparency you have to have a hundred

different in transparencies and so it

could be hard to come up with that

they're also easily spoiled especially

if somebody is playing on live streaming

service like twitch

one person in the chat can just tell

them the answer and then it's all over

so in transparencies are often not that

great and and the reverse can also be

bad if the streamer

knows what's going on or knows the

answer but the audience doesn't then

they'll just have to constantly explain

the rules to them which can make the

streaming experience a bit worse

a very common example is the hidden

affordance which is where you have some

kind of affordance or thing you can do

that is not tutorial to you or not told

to you and this is an example from the

wind waker you get this grappling hook

and it sort of tells you how to use it

and you can swing on things

um but there is another thing you can do

with that and that is when you are

swinging you can also stop swinging and

climb the rope

and when i was playing this game i never

even knew you could do this

and the method to do it is actually a

little bit counter-intuitive you have to

hold the button

that in the top right the the z-r button

here which basically stops you from

swinging

and then while holding that you have to

press up to climb the rope

um and normally when you press up you

press like up and down to swing back and

forward and time your swings to move

forward so there's

there's a second movement assigned to

the same button

uh and you have to climb up to the top

of this rope and now it's only required

in a couple areas of the game to get a

couple of secrets but you know i want

100 the dungeon i want to find all the

secrets so

uh it was really annoying to me that

this was never explained and then i just

had to figure it out uh and it's

counterintuitive

and they also this this was a port of

the game uh an hd port of the game

from the original gamecube to the wii u

and so they had to change the controls

so they may have not tested it enough

they may have not done their focus

testing to discover that this was a

stuck point or they might have just left

it in because it was only for a couple

of puzzles anyway

um but for some players this is very

frustrating and it could really make you

distrust the developers and normally you

don't see stuff like this in zelda

because it's quite well tested

but in this one case it was really you

know there are people online who raged

about this quite a bit

one of the ways you can avoid that is

tip number 16 which is to facilitate

experimentation um and i will show the

remove octahedron again as a way of

illustrating this basically like

it's clear that there's something

rattling around on the inside of it and

it's clear that if you kind of try to

push it this way

you can push it a little but it gets

stuck and

you can listen and you can discover that

okay there's some balls on the inside or

something moving around

and if you move it very slowly and

listen you can even try and hear what is

the shape of the cavity inside

this puzzle how many balls are there are

they in the same cavity or are they not

and you can learn all of these things

just by experimenting and slowly moving

the thing around in information

so the in transparency of what's in the

middle can be made transparent by your

own

interaction with the puzzle um you know

and and you will in fact discover in

this puzzle that there are two balls

inside

they are in the same chamber and that

chamber has the shape of an s

tetris piece and you have to get the

balls at the two opposite sides of it

because

the thing you're pushing down goes in

the middle so you kind of have to do a

spin move to get the two balls to the

opposite side to push it down which is

an interesting

eureka moment but one that you can

actually kind of deductively logic

yourself toward

if you experiment with it enough to

discover how it works

a rule of thumb that goes along with

this is avoid

making experimentation frustrating

i remember as a kid playing link to the

past and getting to this boss the

helmesor king

and this boss is really tough he comes

at the end of a long

gauntlet of difficult enemies that you

have to get through and if you die you

have to restart the whole dungeon and do

it all over again

and he is the first boss that you cannot

defeat using the sword alone

every other boss up until that point you

could just use the sword on them but

this guy you have to use the hammer on

him first and

you know it's the usual zelda trope use

the item from that dungeon to

defeat the boss of that dungeon but this

was the first time that that idea was

used in this game

and i remember being so frustrated that

i would get to this boss fight him my

sword would do nothing and i didn't know

what to do and i would just die

because this guy just hit so hard and

you know i would try that a few times

die get frustrated and then

not know what to do because i wasn't

able to easily experiment and figure out

what the boss's weak point was the

experimentation required all of this

effort beforehand

and i remember going to my cousin and

begging him to tell me how to beat this

boss

and he told me hit his mask with the

magic hammer

and i i still as an assault as an adult

remember those exact words that he used

because as a child this was so

pertinent and so salient to me when i'm

like fighting this boss and was

literally blocked by progressing in the

game

because i i didn't know that secret and

certainly that was a huge eureka moment

for me just being told the answer

because it was so important to being

able to progress in this game

but the thing that caused that

frustration was the fact that i couldn't

experiment or at least that

experimentation required so much effort

that i was never able to get there on my

own

another example uh and i love this by

the way is the hearthstone puzzle labs

which was an expansion to the

hearthstone

uh game made i think a year or two ago

um and there are a bunch of these

puzzles that you have to solve using

hearthstone cards and they're very

interesting very exciting i highly

highly recommend this even if you've

never played hearthstone

um but this particular puzzle uh

is a doozy it's called the test and

there is this

unit on the board called the test

subject and it has the property that

whenever it dies

it gives you a copy of every spell

you've ever played on it

and there is also a spell that you have

in this called vivid nightmare that

copies

a minion and when you copy a minion it

kind of also copies the triggers that

are attached to that minion so there's

this very sophisticated interaction of

creating copies of spells via minions

that you've copied

and there are also a bunch of spells

that you have that change the health of

minions and kill them and

and do various things um so the solution

to this puzzle you know you only have 10

cards in your hand but you actually may

end up playing 20 or 30 of them

to actually go through with it and for

each one of the cards you play you have

to sort of watch through its animation

sometimes there's voice lines uh and

the order of operations is very

important and even

learning what the priority of things are

like when a death happens in what order

do the triggers happen that order of

trigger interaction is relevant in this

puzzle

and the first time i solved this puzzle

or actually the first time i put

together a solution that i thought would

solve this puzzle

it turned out that it didn't work due to

some subtlety of the interactions that i

didn't know

and this was immensely frustrating but

was even more frustrating is that

that thing on the right over there is

not an undo button it is a reset button

there is no undo in this puzzle

and when you reset it clears the whole

board it plays an unskippable eight

second

animation there's a voice line that

comes from the the boss on the other

side who makes fun of you

and uh it's just the experience of

experimenting to learn what happens is

made very tedious by the interface

and you know hearthstone isn't a puzzle

game it is it is a game

uh that's very much about sort of the

charming whimsy of the interaction of

these cards in a magical universe and

those voice lines are part of what makes

hearthstone hearthstone

uh but in the context of a puzzle game

it it sort of became

very irritating for me to like actually

interface with the puzzle itself

um so it's something to keep in mind

that if you make experimentation

frustrating and if you make sort of

learning the underlying system of the

puzzle

difficult or frustrating or place

obstacles in front of the player of

doing that

then uh the player may never get to the

heart of the puzzle and may just give up

right they won't be uh you know driven

to continue playing by the exciting

thing around the corner they'll just be

like ugh

i can't be bothered one solution

to avoid making experimentation

necessary at all

is to show the player things that they

would otherwise have to find out don't

put a button on the ground

and make the player stand on it to see

what it does put a line next to the

button and a little indicator on the

wall

that can show the player what the puzzle

is going to do when they step on it this

is something that portal did

you know a decade and a half ago

it'll do does something even more

interesting where when you whenever you

hit a locked door or a locked gate

it will show these little particles that

travel from the locked gate to either

the buttons on the floor or the switches

that you have to hit

in order to activate it uh and this

removes the need for you to

figure out what combination of switches

you need to hit to open this door

and games like draw at deadly rooms of

death also do the same thing

so a related idea is always try to get

the solver on the right path

realizing that you're on the right track

is one of the most dopaminergic things

just in the same way that anticipating

you know a eureka moment being right

around the corner

is is really interesting sort of being

on the right track and being told that

you're on the right track

is is similarly very motivating uh in

american crosswords every letter is

checked meaning that every letter exists

in both the horizontal and vertical word

and when you get that confirmation and

ah yes this is the same letter when i've

solved both of these clues it gives you

this sort of satisfaction that you're

moving forward that you're making

correct progress

many crossword clues they may have

multiple possible answers right

there may be multiple possible words

that are four letters long and satisfy

this clue

but as we've sort of seen in some of the

earlier examples only one of them is

correct and you may not

know which one it is until you get this

confirmer

but the confirmer is sort of a push to

keep going and motivation

to understand that you're on the right

track

um cryptics actually do this within

individual clues

so uh in encrypted crosswords if you

don't know every clue actually contains

both a literal definition

and a sort of pun or cryptic

definition so you might see a seven

letter word for terrain scrambled coach

and you split it down the middle a coach

is a trainer

but the word terrain scrambled i.e

anagrams

is also the word trainer so within every

individual clue

you have a confirmer because you have

two sides of it

that make the answer and sometimes when

you're solving a cryptic you won't

necessarily solve both of them like you

might solve the literal clue and not

solve the other one and sort of check it

by the letter crossings

cryptics have fewer letter crossings

than american crosswords

um but sometimes the

answer kind of reveals what the pun was

and can create this exciting moment of

oh i get it it's terrain scrambled

um you know so it provides additional

sparkle

uh whoops okay we're back

uh let's see um puzzle hunts often also

have confirmers where sometimes

you know you're halfway through a puzzle

and you got somewhere and you you know

you think

maybe is this the answer and then you

type it into the answer box and instead

of saying good job you solve the puzzle

it says keep going and what keep going

means in that context is that that's not

the answer it's another clue

it's something that you can move forward

on in a different direction something

new you have to try

uh but that can also be very motivating

because it means everything you've done

up until now was something that was

intended for you to do

a related question that i often get is

are red herrings bad should you avoid

them

and i mean this is a very complicated

subject there are a lot of different

types of red herrings and whether or not

they're bad is very situational

a dressing is the name for sort of a

needless non-pertinent decoration that's

salient enough that the solver might

accidentally interpret it as pertinent

in chest puzzles for example if you just

add extra pieces that are not relevant

to the solution and don't prevent

any wrong solutions from being relevant

then

those are considered dressings and

they're often frowned upon because they

may distract the solver from what they

actually need to do

same thing in escape rooms like people

often want to decorate the escape room

and make it look nice

but uh you know players may see bars in

a jail and try and you know count them

and put that as a number in some

combination lock right like you gotta

really make sure

that uh your dressings are not

interpreted as

pertinent distractors are affordances

that you never need

um you know there's there's an example

like make 35 cents with 10 coins

and the quarter is not needed therefore

it is a distractor it's an affordance

that you didn't need but it sort of

feels like it should be there right it's

not

it's not a red herring that's going to

confuse you um

you know fake puzzles and ghost puzzles

are things that come up in

escape rooms where you see something

that looks like a puzzle but it turns

out not to be

a ghost puzzle is a puzzle that used to

be in the room and then was removed but

somehow there's some little bit of it

that's left that wasn't cleaned up

you might just see a shadow on the wall

of where something was or you might see

some parts of what used to be a puzzle

but they've been disconnected and are no

longer part of the solution

every escape room fan will tell you that

they've seen these

and they get so mad when that wasn't

taken out of the room because they'll

spend their time which in escape room is

precious you only have an hour to get

out

they'll spend their time trying to

figure out what to do with that thing

and if it turns out oh you didn't have

to do anything it wasn't part of the

puzzle

then that really irritates people it

feels like they've been robbed of their

time

obfuscation and misdirection come in

many forms and can be sometimes

interpreted as red herrings but

sometimes it's more like

uh showing the solver what is a

non-solution so that they can appreciate

the solution more

right there's various ways that

misdirection can actually be good

so you don't want to rule that out as

bad dead end approaches

are any approach that you might try to

solve a puzzle that immediately leads to

a negative confirmer meaning

meaning you try something and then you

learn oh this cannot be the approach

this cannot possibly work

there is a clear dead end to here the

opposite is a rabbit trail

which is an incorrect approach to

solving a puzzle that cannot be proven

not to work

um you know you might be in some block

pushing game and it turns out you have

to do this one thing but you're trying

this other thing

and it seems like you're maybe making

progress and you're trying a few more

things and you know it's just branching

and getting deeper and maybe you're

making progress maybe you're not

but an hour later you're still trying

that one thing and you haven't quite got

to the exit and maybe it's impossible

right but but you don't know you don't

have an obvious proof that's impossible

so you waste an hour trying something

that isn't the intended or correct

solution

rabbit trails are the most demotivating

especially for novices because novices

are not particularly good at guessing

what will work or guessing what the

intended solution method to a puzzle

will be

they may spend a long time and only

change their approach when they've

really just given up and been beaten

down into

thinking well you know i don't want to

try this anymore

to address this like really sealing off

rabbit trails is a good idea if you're

playtesting something and you notice

that players are spending a long time

trying an approach that doesn't work

you should probably either prevent them

from trying it or add a negative

confirmer of some kind you know

go back this isn't the solution not like

this

try something else and to discover those

you

really need to playtest it the the sort

of lesson

expressed in four words is match

pertinence with

salience pertinence meaning things that

are relative to the actual solution of

the puzzle things that are either

clueful

or are affordances that you need or are

interactions that you need to do

and salience meaning how much something

sticks out how

clear is it to the player that this is

important how important looking is

something

things that are important should stick

out things that

stick out should be important you do not

want to have negatives in either

direction you don't necessarily

well you don't want to have important

things that are subtle or at least are

more subtle than everything else in the

environment

and you don't want to have things that

stick out and look like they might be

clueful or might be puzzly that turn out

not to be

and keep in mind that video game players

especially

who are not necessarily experts at

puzzles they may not have the

conventions in

place that allow them to determine what

is clueful

like when you're solving an escape room

and you've done 50 of them

you probably can guess whether or not

something is clueful

if you're doing a mystery hunt puzzle

and you've done hundreds of them and you

see something you can probably guess

whether or not that's supposed to be a

clue or whether it's supposed to be just

you know flavor text flavor art not

relevant

but newer players are not able to make

that distinction

uh especially in video games because

video games have

conventions that change so much from

genre to genre

that it's it's very hard to play for

players to know what they know or know

what they're expected to know or know

what the game designer is expecting them

to

interpret so always try to match

pertinence with salience as much as you

can

next lesson is to seek depth in systems

and rule sets

this is a lesson that comes from

physical puzzle games

uh particularly those published by um

publishers like think fun and smart

games they have this interesting method

of putting together

physical puzzles rather than getting

just you know one puzzle like one of

these that you buy

they have a kit that comes with

different items that you can put

together

and then they'll have a booklet or a set

of cards that contain challenges and

each puzzle will come with say 50 to 100

different challenges of increasing

difficulty

almost in the same kind of progression

that you would see in a traditional

video

game um and so rush hour you're sort of

moving these cars around you have to get

the red car

out of the grid and there's just 50

different configurations of obstacles

for it

um each of which you have to solve and

so

it's a nice experience for somebody

buying these because they're sort of

more content it's not just one puzzle

it also can make manufacturing much

cheaper because you sort of have to

just make the set of parts once and then

make the 50 puzzles

uh the cards are really cheap to make 50

of and you don't have to make 50 copies

of the game board

it also allows the player to have a

conceptual model meaning develop a

sophisticated understanding

of what the pieces are how the work how

they move how they work how they move

around

once you have a eureka moment or a

discovery of an emergent consequence of

that system

you can reuse that knowledge in future

puzzles and puzzles can therefore

build upon one another with increasingly

complicated

sort of lemmas and templates and

theorems that the player can learn as

they're solving this puzzle

and as they develop a more and more

detailed model of what are the

consequences of this system so you get

depth and you also get consistency in

the design

and the emergent surprises can be much

much deeper than just some sort of

one-off on the surface trick

you know something something like the

remove octahedra and that's sort of one

trick that you can use one time

but in systems-based puzzles you can

have many different tricks that arise

from the same situation

this can make the eureka moment sort of

more exciting because they're more

surprising

because there's more depth behind them

they can also reduce the cost of content

creation

because you know you only have to make

one of these cards and designing a new

instance of a puzzle is

often a lot less difficult than

designing a new rule set or a new

gimmick for a new puzzle completely

i'll give you another example which is

from thomas snyder he's a three-time

world sudoku champion world puzzle

champion

he's the founder of grand master puzzles

which is a company that publishes a

puzzle blog as well as many puzzle

books and puzzle magazines he's also a

mentor to many people on topics relating

to puzzle design he's an advisor on my

latest

project uh he has this idea

which he's described to me as sort of

the capacity of a puzzle or the the

um the sort of space available to

in within a certain puzzle type to

express ideas of that puzzle

and the way he describes it is in two

different ways which are equivalent

how many can you create of this puzzle

type before you start repeating the same

tricks over and over again like say

you're doing sudoku

how many sudoku's can you make before

the solution to the

sudoku's is just going to have no new

ideas and the answer is it's probably

somewhere between 50 and 100 it might be

like 80 sudokus

he also describes it as how many of this

puzzle type he would actually want to do

in his life like say somebody made the

perfect puzzle book

of sudoku puzzles let's say and you know

tried to include

all of the interesting sudoku tricks in

there but not really repeat them much

you know how many puzzles would that

book have in it it's not a thousand

sudoku puzzles it's much less

and different puzzle types have

different capacities

you know a simple two-dimensional maze

you know you can do one of them and then

you sort of learn well okay follow the

right-hand side or whatever

there's not that much to do something

like a portal gun may only really

support

10 different unique eureka moments

sudoku might be more like a hundred

and a game like the witness could be 10

times that just because it has so many

different

uh components that can go into those

puzzle systems different rules different

uh

symbols and constraints within each

puzzle

go problems might be the deepest of them

all i i think there are people who've

solved ten thousand go puzzles or more

and are still finding unique and

interesting ideas

in new puzzles that they haven't seen

before and that's something

a bit unique and remarkable about the

game of go whose rules are very simple

but

somehow there's this unexpected depth

there where you can express

tens of thousands of different ideas

using the sort of basic

uh go rules um

you know you might think are there

really only 10 portal gun puzzles like

portal had more levels than that right

like aren't there more ideas than that

well

i mean i'm talking about just the basic

sort of portal gun and walls there's not

that many things you can do with it like

there's traversal there's some line of

sight shooting tricks you can put a

portal on the ceiling there's the

momentum conservation trick

there's a lot of tricks where you sort

of move one portal but leave another in

order to be able to get back to a place

where you were before

but very quickly you start running out

of ideas to make truly unique

puzzles and then you start to add you

know you need to add new components the

the death pits and the missile turrets

and the companion cubes and the buttons

you can push them on

and then in portal 2 they add the light

bridges and the anti-gravity spirals and

the

the the paint that you can paint on the

walls to make them portable and the

bouncy colored goop that you can speed

off of and bounce on

you know these new components are what's

adding additional capacity to the

puzzles to be able to express

more unique eureka moments but just the

raw ingredients

uh are not really that uh

they can't speak to that many eureka

moments there's just not that much there

and what logic puzzle folks do is they

often create hybrids and variants

these are all sort of variations on

sudoku you can see here there's one

where the regions are not square there's

a hex grid

there's a ish grid or sort of on the

surface of this isometric cube

um and then increasingly complex

variations uh or hybrids as they are

often called where you're blending one

type of puzzle like sudoku with another

type like a domino puzzle

and through hybrids and variations you

can sort of have limitless variety and

endless eureka moments

uh because each of these puzzles sort of

has has its own rules and its own

consequences

and its own emergent complexity or

lemmas that arise from that set of rules

there are some sort of common tropes in

these changing geometry or topology

moving from

you know flat geometry to a cylinder or

a torus moving from a square grid to

triangle or hex or

whatever other grid type you want adding

new constraints and clue types

combining two puzzle types together liar

clues you know exactly one of these

clues is wrong there's a wolf in sheep's

clothing somewhere

cipher clues where you replace numbers

in a grid with a set of letters and each

letter

corresponds to a unique number off by

one or or cannot deny bin as it's often

called

uh where every number in the grid is off

by one you know a three could be either

a two or a four you know these are

common ideas you'll see over and over

again in logic puzzles

and they add a lot of depth and

complexity

sort of new eureka moments um

there's this question like where does

depth come from

in certain types of puzzle systems

somehow go is inherently deep

and it's very difficult to understand

why it is so

deep there is this computational

complexity answer which is like oh you

know a go

go is np-complete or piece-based

complete if you're familiar with

complexity theory

and that sort of represents that go can

sort of encode

other types of puzzles which are

increasingly complex and that may be

true but often

uh the way you represent something very

complex is like

you know building a circuit out of ghost

stones and then like this circuit is

only satisfiable if

you know player white wins in this go

situation

and those can be very contrived what's

unique about go

is that it's complex even with

relatively simple constructions of you

know a little puzzle that takes up one

quarter of a go board or less

um without necessarily a lot of

contrivance right

games like hearthstone have huge amount

of contrivance to their puzzles because

there's thousands of cards in the game

you'll never run out of puzzles to

create because there's just so many

cards there

and some games like the witness or baba

is you they get away with the

interaction between the different rules

and constraints

giving you this emergent complexity you

know you may have uh

n different rules but there are sort of

two to the n different ways that those

can be combined together and so you sort

of

you know there are n squared ways for

example that you can take a pair of

rules and combine them but sometimes

even three or more

will give you unique emergent eurekas

that don't exist with two or less

of the rules combined especially in a

game like baba is you

where sometimes you need five rules put

together and then something magical can

happen

level geometry is another thing that can

give you

really interesting deep emergent

interactions a few examples of this

one is steven's sausage roll which is a

game where you're running around

as this little character with a fork

skewering sausages pushing them around

picking them up and later you know

dragging them up ladders and doing

interesting contortions with with your

body and various other things

which uh um you know i almost don't want

to spoil them because they're magical i

know i've been spoiling a lot of stuff

in this talk

when you're talking about puzzle design

you invariably have to spoil things

um but this is a game that is worth

playing

uh to the end or you know at least

learning all of the things that it does

uh because it's so remarkable like like

there's no

new items you pick up when you're

playing steven saucer

you don't open a chest and get the hook

shot or the power glove you know it's

all

just the base movement of the game two

other games that are similar are pipe

push paradise and a monsters expedition

where you really just have

a sort of a simple move and push type of

mechanic

but a lot of emergent complexity via the

interactions that happen with the

objects you know in pipe push paradise

you can sort of push

pipes down into holes and roll them over

while a piece of them

goes into a hole and then comes back out

uh in a monster's exposition you're

rolling a log

over another log and then pushing them

into the water and then

while in the water there's different

things you can do with them it's uh

quite an interesting experience and both

of these games are massive rabbit holes

to go down a monster's expedition has

i like 500 600 i don't know how many

levels it has a lot of levels

hundreds of them um containing dozens

and dozens of unique ideas

that are all consequences of basically

just moving cylinders around

and if you have a sufficiently complex

system

then just through changing the shape of

levels you can allow the player to

experience

all of these different things you can do

without adding too much in the way

of new mechanics or new things i mean

all of these games do have new mechanics

and new things right steven's sausage

roll at some point adds in ladders

pipe push paradise at some point adds in

the ability to rotate a pipe

monster's expedition at some point adds

in uh rocks of different heights

uh but it doesn't add too much of them

there's a very low amount of new things

whereas some puzzle games every five

puzzles they give you you know a new toy

to play with or a new

uh ability to use these games are very

minimal on that and instead try to

explore the space of available ideas or

or consequences of those ideas

as much as possible most of the sort of

common puzzle tropes that you see

over and over again in puzzle games are

there because they combine two things

one is they're actually hard they

they're sort of np-hard or p-space hard

or have some kind of actual complexity

theoretic

hardness to them meaning they can encode

many hard problems

but they also they aren't too chaotic

and random they're things that

humans can reason about and facilitate

uh deeper understanding of you know

connectivity and paths human brains are

just great at seeing when things are

touching when they're adjacent

you know when this blob is one thing

instead of two things

packing or covering like shapes mental

rotation to fit things together

perspective or line of sight sort of 3d

geometry of when something can be seen

from something else

these are all things that human brains

are just naturally good at reasoning

about

logic gates and state manipulation these

are just you know

good examples of ways to get complexity

in puzzle games but also allow the

puzzles to be things that have exciting

eureka moments that humans can discover

um next lesson is to understand your

puzzles

state space and this lesson comes to us

via a puzzle designer this is um his

name is oscar von devunter

and uh he makes a lot of different types

of physical puzzles

twisty puzzles uh he prototypes

themselves with a 3d printer he's got a

youtube channel which is

quite interesting to check out he's very

prolific

this is a puzzle that he worked on which

is published by a company called

hanayama puzzles

it's the cast h and they're these two

h-shaped pieces which can kind of

be stuck together and roll around one

another in these interesting 3d way

ways the goal is to separate the two

pieces but to do this requires a huge

number of moves

and oscar actually published the state

diagram of this puzzle these are sort of

all the different configurations that

these two pieces can be

in and the lines represent possible

transitions from those states

so wherever there is a line it means you

can get the two puzzle

pieces from that one state to the other

one and when there isn't a line it means

that somehow that transition has been

blocked either by a little nubby of the

puzzle a little piece of metal that kind

of just prevents you

from uh making that transition and

therefore

finding a solution to this puzzle is

equivalent to finding a path

through this graph from in to out along

these edges and creating this puzzle was

basically

a task of like snipping certain edges

until

the graph that remained was an

interesting maze to navigate that

didn't have too many dead ends but also

had some trails for you to wander down

which may or may not

lead you to the correct thing uh

i'll show you another example from

sokoban this is a paper by peter

yaroshek and

radek pelanek and in this puzzle they

take a bunch of instances of sokoban

and they diagram their state space using

a sort of node and edge graph

representation where each node

is an individual state of the puzzle and

each edge is sort of a connection

between those two states

and a state in this case con consists of

a location of where the boxes are

and a connected region where the player

is so individual moves are not

considered state changes unless they

push a box

um but as you can see with this puzzle

there's this really tight bottleneck

around down here and that's sort of

is what makes this puzzle difficult

there is one unique

sort of key move or trick that you have

to do in order to get to the goal

and the coloring here is based on

players trying to attempt to solve this

puzzle and how much time they spent in

each state of the puzzle

the size of the dot corresponds to how

long players spent and you could see

that they spend a lot of time

not getting through the bottleneck and

once they get through there's hardly any

time spent at all because they're

immediately able to get to the goal and

so understanding that state diagram

allows you to sort of control

aspects of your puzzle by manipulating

it the larger the state space is

obviously the more difficult the more

possible states but the bottlenecks are

what create difficulty and if you have

multiple bottlenecks

that can make things even more difficult

this

in particular this sokoban puzzle is one

that takes an average of 30 to 40

minutes for players to solve this is a

really nasty one uh and that bottleneck

is the reason could you imagine if this

puzzle had a second one

afterwards uh players could be here for

a long time um so a related idea

is to understand your puzzle's solution

path and when i say solution path i

don't necessarily mean

just the path through that state diagram

but also the sort of

the state of the player as they're

solving the puzzle and

what are all of the understandings or

eureka moments that the player will go

through how are they going to make

progress through your puzzle noah

falstein gave a talk

in 2013 at gdc where he talked about

these dependency diagrams that they used

uh for adventure games of the puzzles

and this is sort of like the

pre-requisite chain of all the different

things you had to do in order to get

through this

this isn't even a whole game this is

like the intro sequence to this game

and one of the the pieces of advice sort

of the main piece of advice

he gave was to make these diagrams bushy

meaning not a long linear prerequisite

chain

but sort of a lot of different things

that you could make process

on concurrently without them sort of

blocking each other as prerequisites

and the reason to do this was to allow

the player to sort of explore and be

able to make progress in multiple areas

of the game without restricting them too

much without having that one single

bottleneck which would force the player

to do this one thing and everywhere else

in the game is just kind of useless to

them

um cameron brown has this interesting

illustration

where he shows slitherlink puzzles and

the rules of this puzzle are essentially

you're given as input

a grid made of dots and some numbers in

there and you have to draw a single

closed loop

uh around this grid and the numbers

indicate

sort of the uh adjacency uh how many

edges of that loop are adjacent to the

number so for example this three right

here

has three walls next to it this one

right here has one this this two right

here has two

um and slitherlink exists in some video

games as well the witness has a version

of slytherlink there are some other

games that have

similar ideas um but here on the top

he's showing a computer-generated puzzle

that was sort of randomly constructed

and on the bottom there's a

human-constructed puzzle

and the way in which the solver goes

from the initial puzzle to the solution

is very different for these two puzzles

on the bottom one there's kind of two

places you can make progress and you

sort of linearly do the bottom half the

loop and the top half of the loop and

they meet together

whereas this top one you can start just

about anywhere on any corner of the grid

and then you kind of get about this much

before you then have to

uh solve some more here's a bigger

example of a human-constructed

slitherlink puzzle where there's sort of

like three different

places where you can make progress

linearly and then in the middle uh they

all come together and and make the final

solution to the puzzle

and so as a solver you can start in a

couple of these different corners and

make progress

but when you're going along each section

there's this sort of smooth

flow of oh i did this oh now i get this

oh now i get this oh now i get this

and it feels very um exciting as a

solver

to feel that you're on the right track

and for every bit of progress to then

unlock further progress it sort of makes

that progress feel even better because

in addition to solving part of the grid

you're also

allowing yourself to solve another part

of the grid

so it's it's very exciting the linear

solution path

can be much harder especially for a

large puzzle because you may not know

where to start if you have a big grid

and there's literally only one place

where you can make progress then that

can

take a lot of time to find um whereas if

you have a bushy solution path then the

solver is less likely to be stuck

and can sort of proceed from more areas

and feel like they're making progress

sooner

but yeah the linear solution pass can

lead to sort of these interesting

solution flows that can be more of a

work of art and can be more exciting um

let's see so uh yeah this this is an

idea that

um we use internally working on our new

game

which is how big is the puzzle grid

versus how difficult it is

uh you know if it has few steps and it's

trivially difficult then it's

you know it's whatever it's boring it's

a tutorial puzzle it's nothing

but the two types that are interesting

are if you have many steps of low

difficulty we call this a flow puzzle

versus you have few steps but high

difficulty maybe only one difficult step

and sort of the whole puzzle is about

figuring out that one difficult

interesting thing we call that a gem

puzzle

and of course if you have many steps in

high difficulty then it's just a slog

it's going to be

you know it's going to take a long time

it's something you really got to get

invested into

but the flowy puzzles and the gems are

usually the most

suitable for video games and for us

they've been the most interesting

um i'm going to take a break and then we

will come back for the final part
