Hi welcome back to part two of my extended director's cut of my GDC talk on 30 puzzle design lessons from classic puzzle communities and how those lessons can be applied to the creation of video game puzzles
大家好，欢迎回到我的GDC演讲"来自经典谜题社区的30节谜题设计课，以及如何将这些经验应用到视频游戏谜题的创作中"的第二部分
The 11th lesson is "create a rewarding ending" 
第11节课是「创造一个有收获的结局」
and the quintessential example of this is the puzzle Picross aka Nanograms
这方面最典型的例子是Picross，也就是"数织"
（译者注：Nanogram数织游戏，在一个空白网格中，每行每列前面都标注有该行或该列中连续相邻黑格的长度，玩家据此来涂色）
which the Picross games have been published by Nintendo since the 90s 
任天堂从90年代开始发行Picross游戏
and I think the first nanograms were published in the late 80s in various Japanese puzzle magazines.
而我认为第一个数织游戏是在80年代末发表在各种日本解谜杂志上的
There's an interesting story about the origin of them.
关于它的起源有一个有趣的故事
They were created by two different authors seemingly simultaneously, 
数织是由两个不同作者独立创造的
（译者注：即由 西尾徹也 和 いしだのん 二人独立创作的）
but alas one of the exciting things about nanograms is at the end you sort of get this picture 
数织游戏令人兴奋的一点是，在最后你会得到这样的图案
and there's always this question like what is the picture gonna be,
（在解的过程中）总会产生比如"这个图案会是什么呢？"的问题
anticipation for uh sort of that exciting moment 
对那个激动人心的时刻有一种期盼
where the picture or the identity of the picture, What is it? Oh, it's a rubber duck! It's a lion! It’s finally revealed.
这个图案或图案代表的是什么呢？哦，是一只橡皮鸭！是一只狮子！最终终于被揭开了
Another example is this puzzle Spiral Galaxies which it doesn't have an ending surprise step at the end 
另一个例子是"螺旋星系"谜题，它本身是没有一个惊喜的结尾的
but a variant of it does and I will show you the classic first
但它的一个变体却有，我先给你们看经典版本
So, this is the classic spiral galaxies. 
这就是经典版本的螺旋星系
The goal is to partition the grid into these regions, 
游戏目标是将网格划分为一些区域
each of which contains exactly one dot and the shape of the region is rotationally symmetric 180 degrees around that dot.
每个区域正好包含一个点，而且每个区域围绕那个点中心对称
It's a very interesting puzzle.
这是一个非常有趣的谜题
There's a lot of fascinating logic that goes into solving them.
深入研究的话就会有很多迷人的逻辑
But another similar type of puzzle which is printed by Nikoli under the name "Tentai Show" 
不过有一种类似的谜题，是Nikoli以"Tentaishou"的名字刊发的
which is a hilarious pun if you know Japanese.
如果你懂日语的话，（" Tentaishou"）这个名字还是个滑稽的双关
"taishou" means symmetry and ten means symmetry about a point 
「点」(ten)是点的意思，「対称」(taishou）是对称的意思，合起来就是点对称
but "tentai" also means sort of a heavenly body like a galaxy, so, this is a show of heavenly bodies.
但「天体」(tentai)又是天体的意思，所以，这又是"天体show"
Excellent pun.
很棒的双关
Anyways digression 
无论如何，有点跑题了
this was first published in Nikoli magazine in 2001 by an author who goes by Gesaku 
这个在2001年首次发表在Nikoli杂志上的作品，作者叫Gesaku
and it's essentially a spiral galaxy's puzzle where some of the dots are dark colored 
它本质上还是一个螺旋星系谜题，不过其中一些点是涂黑了的
and if you shade the dark colored dots, you get a shape 
如果你把黑点对应的区域上色的话，就会得到一个形状
and here's a more sophisticated example quite a large instance 
这里有一个更复杂的例子，相当大的一个例子
when you solve it, you get this and the shape is that of an astronaut 
当你解出来的时候，你会得到一个宇航员的图形
uh quite an interesting uh composition that's been put together
非常有趣的构图
and you might ask well is the puzzle boring because of this 
你可能会问，这样做了之后谜题会不会变得无聊？
does this sort of compromise the flow of the puzzle because you're having to make all of these regions fit together in exactly this way
这是否会牺牲解谜过程，因为必须得让这些区域按图形这种方式组合在一起
and the answer is mostly not 
答案是大部分不会
like if you look over to the left side of this puzzle, you can kind of see there's really elaborate snaking and winding regions going all over the place 
如果你看一下这个谜题的左边，你可以看到有一些精心设计的蜿蜒曲折的区域
and those are quite interesting to solve and to sort of figure out the logic of how that must be shaped
这些解起来都很有趣，而且弄清楚形状形成的逻辑也很有趣
however, putting those in sort of requires large amounts of just one color of region 
然而，把这些形状融入进去就会让很多区域是同一种颜色
and that can sort of force the design 
这可能会影响到设计
if you wanted to make a qr code into this then probably most of the puzzle would be relatively uninteresting to solve
如果你想弄成个二维码图案的谜题，那么谜题大部分解起来就会相对无趣了
it relies or depends heavily on uh the shape being a certain way 
这在很大程度上依赖于形状本身
here's an example that kind of illustrates that 
这里有一个例子可以说明这一点
this is you know I’m just putting this together to show off its GDC 2021
这个是我做的一个展现出GDC2021的图案
but this is actually made using a text generator by Erik Demaine and Martin Demaine 
我这个实际上是用Erik Demaine和Martin Demaine的文本生成器来生成的
（译者注：用文本生成Tentai Show谜题的生成器在：https://erikdemaine.org/fonts/spiralgalaxies/）
and it shows you know you can do whatever you want with these Tentai Show puzzles 
这个就表面了你可以用任何图案来制作Tentai Show谜题
but like you know this is the 2 and it's just a diagonal set of one by one things 
但你看这是个2，它只是一个一个点斜着摆放而已
it's not particularly interesting or solve or fun to solve
这个解起来并不是特别有趣
another example of putting a surprise at the end of the puzzle 
另一个在谜题结尾加入惊喜的例子是
are the extraction steps that occur in puzzle hunts like the MIT mystery hunt
在解谜寻宝比赛中的"提炼步骤"，比如MIT解谜寻宝比赛
where every single puzzle has a solution that is a word or a phrase and often those are used in metapuzzles or other things
在那里面每道谜题的答案都是一个单词或短语，而这些答案又经常被用于"元谜题"(metapuzzle)或其他一些东西里面
（译者注：元谜题 meta puzzle，几个谜题的答案本身又组成一个新的谜题）
here's a Tentai show puzzle whose answer is actually a five letter word
这里有一道Tentai Show谜题，它的答案是一个五个字母的单词
and if you solve it, you get this and maybe you can guess what the five letter word answer is 
如果你解开它，你会得到这样一个图案，那么你也许能猜出这个答案是什么
of course, it is clubs 
当然，答案是"梅花" ♣
this is by Pavel Curtis from his blog Adalogical Ænigmas 
这个谜题是来自Pavel Curtis的博客Adalogical Ænigmas
（译者注：pavelspuzzles.com/aenigmas/）
which has a lot of interesting puzzles that have a word or phrase as an answer
他有很多用一个单词或短语作为答案的有趣的谜题
the extraction steps have a couple of values
"提炼步骤"有几个方面的价值
they provide this additional final eureka moment which can be especially exciting if you're anticipating it or there's a little bit of a surprise at the end
它们提供了最后这样一个额外的尤里卡时刻，如果你期待它出现的话，那么它会非常地令人兴奋
they also exploit the peak end rule which means uh well the the things that people tend to remember the most are are sort of the the peak or the most salient part of an experience as well as the ending or the last thing
它们还利用了「峰终定律(Peak-End Rule)」：人们倾向于记住一段体验中的高峰或最突出的部分，以及结尾部分
and so, if the last part of an experience is somehow exciting or memorable
因此，如果一个体验的结尾部分是令人激动或难忘的话， 
then overall the experience will be viewed more positively
那么总体来说，这个体验会被更加积极地看待
and so that's true of puzzles like these 
而谜题也是如此
it also can create setups for metapuzzles where words like clubs can be used as ingredients in another puzzle 
它还能为元谜题创造条件，像"梅花"这样的单词可以被用作另一个谜题的成分
and many uh puzzle hunts like MIT mystery hunter set up with these meta puzzles that are sort of like boss puzzles 
而许多解谜寻宝比赛，比如MIT解谜寻宝比赛，会设置这样的元谜题来作为类似说最后的Boss谜题
where there might be 12 other puzzles you need to solve and then you take those 12 words and you use them to solve this final puzzle 
你可能得先解决另外12个谜题，然后拿着这12个单词来解决这最后的谜题
and maybe only eight to ten of those twelve are actually needed
或者也许实际上只需要其中8到10个单词
so, uh it can create a sort of progression gate where you don't necessarily need to solve everything but you need to solve most of it
所以这样可以创造一种阶段性门槛，你不一定得解决全部谜题，可能解决其中大部分就行了
um and that can be very useful for uh pacing and structuring a puzzle hunt
这对于设置解谜寻宝比赛的节奏和步骤非常有用


lesson number 12 is to embed secrets and surprises
第12课是「藏入一些秘密和惊喜」
and this is sort of another way of cramming more eureka moments into the same puzzle
这算是向同一道谜题中塞入更多尤里卡时刻的另一种方式
I’ll show you one example from cryptic crosswords 
我给你看一个Cryptic Crossword的例子
（译者注：Cryptic Crossword是一种在英国特别流行的填字游戏，其中每个词的线索都是一个字谜）
these things are called Ninas and they are sort of little easter eggs hidden in a puzzle 
这种东西被称作「Nina」，它们算是藏在谜题中的小彩蛋
in this puzzle if you read the words going around the outside or the letters it will say 
在这道谜题中，如果你把沿着外框周围的字母按顺序读出来就是：
"Monty Python’s Flying Circus" , sort of going sequentially around the border of the puzzle
"Monty Python’s Flying Circus"（《巨蟒剧团之飞翔的马戏团》）
and this is known as a Nina 
这就是所谓的 "Nina"
the name Nina comes from Al Hirschfeld who's a uh he was a comic author in the US 
"Nina"这个叫法来自Al Hirschfeld，他是美国的一位漫画家
and Nina is the name of his daughter 
Nina是他女儿的名字
and here you can see the word Nina is actually hidden in the hair of this character three separate times 
在这里你可以看到"Nina"这个词实际上是藏在这个人物的头发里的，有三个地方
you can see the N-I-N-A
你可以看到N-I-N-A的字母
and he signs his name with a little 3 next to it indicating that there are three Ninas hidden in this one particular comic
他在署名的时候在旁边加了个小的数字3，表面这个漫画中藏了3个"Nina"
and he did this throughout his career after his daughter was born
在他整个职业生涯中，自从他女儿出生之后他都是如此做的
and so Ninas are essentially the untracked secrets or easter eggs of UK crosswords 
所以"Nina"本质上是英国填字游戏中隐藏着的秘密或者说彩蛋
and one feature of them that's very notable is that they are missable 
它们的一个显著特点是，它们是"可错过的"
you could go through this entire crossword solve the whole thing think you were done and not even realize there was something there
你可能把整个填字游戏解出来了，觉得自己做完了，甚至都没有意识到那你还有什么东西
uh is this a problem or is it a feature
那这算是个缺点还是特性呢？
uh well I mean one issue with it being missable is sort of that eureka moment is just not going to be experienced by the whole audience of this puzzle 
这种"可错过的"东西所带来的一个问题是，它对应的尤里卡时刻是没法被所有玩家都体验到的
but on the other hand, the fact that the secret is missable somehow makes it more valuable
但另一方面，这个秘密是"可错过的"这一点，在某种程度上又使它本身更有价值
it creates uh this feeling whenever you're solving one of these this author's puzzles let's say that there might just always be something lurking around the corner
它创造了这样一种感觉，每当你在做这个作者的谜题的时候，总会觉得在角落里会藏着什么东西
and when you do find it it's more of a surprise 
而当你找到它的时候就会有更多的惊喜
and as we learned earlier that the sort of more surprising or unexpected something is the more exciting it is the more dopaminergic it is the the more sparkle is there 
而正如我们前面所学到的，越是令人惊讶或意外的东西，就越令人兴奋、有越高多巴胺能、有更多Sparkle
so, the fact that the secrets are missable provides uh sort of additional excitement when you do find it
所以，秘密是可错过的这一点会让你在解开它的时候有额外的兴奋
um another thing that missable secrets can do especially in video games is they can provide a reason to sort of go back to an old game
可错过的秘密能做到的另一件事是，特别是在电子游戏中，它能提供一个回去玩老游戏的原因
uh like if I go back to a game like Chrono Trigger which is an RPG from the 90s
比如我回去玩《超时空之轮》这样的90年代的RPG
uh there are things you can discover in that game that you didn't discover when you played it the first time 
你会发现一些你第一次玩的时候没发现的东西
whether it's a line of dialogue or it's a sort of a hidden item that you just never knew was there
不论是一段对话或者某个隐藏物品，你之前不知道它的存在
there are so many things and so much depth in a good rpg that you can play it multiple times
一个好的RPG里面有很多东西、很多深度，你可以反反复复玩
and I think some puzzle games like the Witness are starting to incorporate more and more of this into their games as well which is great
我觉得一些解谜游戏，如《见证者》，也开始在里面融入更多这样的东西，这一点很不错


um lesson number 13 aporia is a promise of surprise
第13课「Aporia(困惑)是惊喜的前兆」
aporia is a state when you're solving a puzzle where you as a solver believe that the puzzle is impossible 
Aporia（困惑）是解谜时的一种状态，作为解谜者，你感觉这个谜题是不可能的
you may even feel like you have a proof that it's impossible
甚至感觉自己能找到证据证明它是不可能的
I need to do this… but there's a catch! I just can't 
“我需要这样做...但有个难点！我做不到”
what's the trick? 
“这里面有什么诀窍？”
um this may also be called a “known unknown”
这也可以被称作”已知的未知”
where you as a solver know that there is something that you don't know
作为一个解谜者，你知道有一些你不知道的东西
you think that ah well I mean this this puzzle is in this game or this person has you know built and shipped this puzzle to me which I have in my hands it must have a solution 
你会觉得既然这个谜题已经摆在我面前了，那总能解得出来吧
and yet I convinced myself that I believe it has no solution
但我总还是相信这东西解不出来
uh an example a simple example is with this puzzle here uh that I created uh 
举一个简单的例子，这是我制作的一个谜题。
I’ll show you how it works
我给你看看它怎么玩的
uh let's switch to the full cam um
让我切下摄像头
this object right here we'll call the cage 
这个东西，我把它叫做”笼子”
and there are two other parts which I will call A and B
还有另外两个部分，我称之为A和B
here's A it's sort of got the L-shaped Tetris piece connected to the S-shape
这是A，它有点像L型的俄罗斯方块跟S型的连在一起
and this is B. B sort of has this three-way junction up near the top
这是B，B的顶部有个像三通一样形状
and the goal is to sort of put A and B into the cage
目标是把A和B插入”笼子”
and well let's just slide A in you can kind of put it in like that
让我们把A放进去，你可以像这样把它放进去
and that's the only place it goes it's very easy to see that 
这是它唯一能放的地方，很容易看出来
and then you try and put b in 
然后你试着把B放进去
and it just like it won't fit. there's not enough room to slide it in
然后它就放不进去了，没有足够的空间
uh you could try putting it in from the bottom it 
你可以试着从底部把它放进去
there's no room to put it in there either
那里也没有空间可以放进去
okay well maybe you don't put A in first. Maybe you have to put B in first 
好吧，可能不能先把A放进去，也许得先把B放进去
and uh you can try that 
你可以试着这样做
you know here's b in I’ll just slide it down there
这个是B，我把它放到这个位置
uh but then you have to put A and you	 can kind of see where it goes
但然后你放A进去，你可以看它的位置
right like it's kind of kind of wrap around there and slide in there but you just you can't slide it in 
它有点像把它包裹住了，放不进去
there's no way to make it work
这样也不行
so, it's not A before B and it's not B before A 
所以，既不是先放A再放B，也不是先放B再放A
well then it must be impossible, right
那么这一定是不可能的，对吗？
but no actually the solution is you take B and you put it in kind of halfway and you stick it up there 
但不是的，实际上解法是你把B放到一半，然后就先不动它
and then you can kind of just put A in half way and slide it in the back 
然后又把A放入到一半的位置，然后从后面把它塞进去
and then b comes down 
然后B就下来了
and there we go and then it's solved uh 
就这样就解决了
so, you know the trick is you have to put A in halfway
所以，诀窍是你必须把A放在一半的地方
um back to the presentation
回到幻灯片
uh so I mean and this isn't a difficult puzzle 
所以我的意思是，这其实并不是一个很难的谜题
this might be a level one or a level two puzzle it's not particularly challenging 
这可能是第1级或第2级的谜题，没有特别的挑战性
but it illustrates the point of the obvious things lead to a non-solution to the puzzle 
但它说明了一点，解谜过程中会有一些明显的东西让这个谜题看起来无解
and you might even be convinced like well then this puzzle's impossible 
并且你甚至可能会说服自己这个谜题是不可能的
you can't put a in first you can't put b in first so clearly it's impossible well okay 
既不能先放A也不能先放B那显然就不可能了
but there was something that you didn't notice 
但其实有些事情你没有注意到
the state of aporia this state of feeling like the puzzle is impossible 
这种Aporia的感觉，这种觉得谜题不可能的感觉
or simultaneously believing both that well I think it's impossible but yet the puzzle is in front of me and a solution has been promised
或者说既感觉这个谜题是不可能，但又觉得这个谜题的解一定是能给出的
um it creates this uh idea that an interesting trick exists 
这产生了这样一个想法，一个有趣的诀窍是存在的
it sort of promises you that a powerful eureka moment is coming and primes you for the discovery of something really cool
它有点在向你预示一个强大的尤里卡时刻即将到来，并让你为发现很酷的东西做准备
and that mystery and anticipation is really motivating like there's a big reveal coming and you can now anticipate it 
那种神秘感和期待真的很有激励性，就像有个大的启示即将到来，已经可以预见它了
and the sort of state of anticipating a reward or anticipating a eureka moment is it can be more motivating and more dopaminergic than actually getting the reward
那种期待奖励或尤里卡时刻的状态，比实际得到奖励更有动力，有更高多巴胺能
um and so this state of aporia is highly motivating 
所以这种Aporia的状态时有高度激励性的
and when a player is convinced that they're just on the cusp of a really cool discovery
而当玩家相信自己正处在即将有一个非常酷的发现的边缘的时候
that could be a time where they're very unlikely to quit and very likely to remember 
这就是他们不太可能放弃的时刻，而且很可能会记住（这个时刻）
and uh you know want to share that discovery once they found it and be very excited by it 
而一旦他们解出来了，就会想与别分享，并为之兴奋
so aporia is a great trick
所以Aporia是一个很好的技巧
I will show you an example this is from a game called Pipe Push Paradise by Corey Martin a few years back
我给你看个例子，这是几年前由Corey Martin制作的叫《推管天堂》的游戏
this is a puzzle where you sort of have to push these pipes around 
谜题中你得把这些管道推来推去
and in this puzzle in particular on the left here you have this pipe with water flowing out 
在这个谜题的左边你能看到一个在流水的管道
and you have to connect it to the one on the right
你得把它跟右边那个连起来
and you might realize well okay so you just have to make this u shape with these two pieces
你可能会意识到，好吧，只需要用这两段管道做成这样一个U字形
you can sort of flip and rotate the pieces around
你可以翻转和旋转这些管道段
the problem is that when you get to this state you can't leave the puzzle
问题是，当你做成这个状态时，你就不能走出这个谜题了
and you have to both connect the pipes up and have a way of exiting 
你必须把管道连接起来并且还要有一个出口
in this case the exit is at the bottom but you just can't get down there
在这种情况下，出口在底部，但你走不过去
and uh you know once you've played with this puzzle a bit you can realize that
一旦你玩过这个谜题，你就会发现
there's no way to be at the puzzle at the bottom of this puzzle while also having the pipes in this configuration 
没有办法把管道弄成这种构造的同时人站在下面
there's just no last move that could have created this configuration and leave you at the bottom
没有任何移动能做出这样的构造，而让你站在底部
you could never have pushed those pipes up into that configuration because there wouldn't have been a place for you to stand um
你不可能把这些管道推到这个位置，因为你根本没有地方可以站立
and one of the things that you'll observe if you're playing around with this puzzle enough is that 
如果你多玩一玩，你就会发现
you can actually rotate the pipes into a different configuration where they're out in three dimensions 
你可以把管道旋转到另一种构造，让它们在三维空间中突出来
this is a three-dimensional puzzle solving game where the rotations sometimes take things up off of the floor 
这其实是个三维的解谜游戏，旋转是可以让东西离开地面的
and this prompts you to find the real solution which is actually to make the archway in the third dimension 
这就促使你找到真正的解法，就是把”拱门”变成三维的
such that you can walk under it and leave the puzzle
这样你就可以从下面走过去，离开这个谜题
and this is a very memorable solution 
这是一个非常令人难忘的解法
but the thing that sort of primes you for this surprise is going back to your first attempt at the solution and realizing this ain't gonna work
但在这个惊喜之前，回到你最初的尝试，你会发现做不到
and perhaps even being so puzzled by it that you might leave the puzzle go try something else 
也许你会感到非常困惑，以至于暂时离开这个谜题去试试别的
and then come back once you've realized that well all the other puzzles had solutions
然后当你意识到其他的谜题都有解决方法时又回来
this one must have one but what am i not thinking of 
那这个谜题也一定可解，但是我有什么地方是没想到的吗
and that final surprise is just so memorable
而最后的惊喜是如此令人难忘
both because it's an exciting surprise but also because of the fact that you couldn't solve it any other means
既是因为它是一个令人兴奋的惊喜，但也是因为你无法用其他任何方式来解决它的这一点事实


now in order to make this work you have to do this which is our 14th lesson 
那么，为了让它发挥作用，你必须要做的事正是我们接下来的第14课
cultivate the trust of the solver
「建立与解题者之间的信任」
and one example of where this comes up is say you're on the puzzle subreddit or the puzzling stack exchange and you just click on a random interesting puzzle
有一个例子可以说明这一点，比如你跑到贴吧上或其他网站上随便找了个看起很有趣的谜题
and it looks cool but you play around with it a bit and it looks impossible
它看起来很酷，但你尝试了一会儿，发现这个看起来解不出来
and maybe you've even convinced yourself that it must be impossible you have a proof that it's impossible
也许你甚至说服了自己这肯定不可能，你有证据说明它不可能
maybe there's a really cool eureka moment lurking beneath the surface that you just didn't discover yet
也许有一个非常酷的尤里卡时刻埋藏在表面之下，只是你还没有发现
but on the other hand maybe just there's a rule missing, there's a piece missing
但另一方面，也许可能只是缺了条规则，谜题少了一块
maybe the person who made this puzzle screwed up or maybe the puzzle uh the poster of the puzzle screwed up
也许制作这道谜题的人搞错了，或者是发帖的人搞错了
and just forgot to include something
而忘了把一些东西加进去
maybe it's intended to be impossible, 
也许这道谜题就是故意无解的
maybe it's you know one of these famous Konigsberg bridge style puzzles that literally has no solution and discovering why is sort of the interesting part of it
也许这就是类似柯尼斯堡七桥问题那种无解的谜题，而去发现为什么无解是它的有趣之处
and I’ve literally seen all of the above on these websites
在这些网站上，我见过上述所有情况
but if it's from a source that I trust or it has a lot of upvotes then maybe it's worth pursuing anyway you know 
但如果谜题是来自我信任的地方，或者有很多人点赞的话，也许就值得一试了
but uh the ability for me to trust that this puzzle is actually something interesting is often limited 
但如果只是一个我不认识的人随便在哪个网站随便发的个帖子的话，
if it's just you know a random post on a random website from somebody I don't know 
那么我去相信这个谜题是真正有趣的可能就很有限了
and I might give up on it before I actually push forward and find that interesting eureka moment
我可能会在我真正找到那个有趣的尤里卡时刻之前就放弃它了
this happens a lot in video games, especially action adventure games in Metroidvania
这种事情在电子游戏中经常发生，特别是在类银河恶魔城动作冒险游戏
let's say you see an interesting puzzle you know there's this heart piece being teased over here in the corner in Zelda
就比如说在塞尔达里面，你看到这样一个谜题，在角落里有一颗心可以去拿
Can I get it right now? 
我现在能拿得到吗？
Maybe I’m missing an item. Maybe I have to come back once I find the hook shot or the glider or whatever 
或许我缺一样物品。可能得等我有勾爪或滑翔伞之后再回来拿
maybe there's an ability I don't have
或许有一种技能是我没有的
maybe the world itself will change. Maybe you know in act three they'll be moving platforms and mushroom sprouting here that I could jump on
或许世界本身会改变，也许可能到第三幕中，这里会出现移动平台或者蘑菇，我可以跳上去
maybe when I become adult link instead of child link I’ll be able to jump that far 
或许等我成为成年林克时就能跳这么远了
maybe the game has a bug
或许游戏有bug
This has happened to me so many times where I play an indie puzzle game the first week it comes out and it just hasn't had a patch yet
我在玩那种刚发售一周还没修复的独立游戏时，遇到过太多这种情况了
and there's some kind of issue with one of the puzzles where I you know I just can't solve it 
里面的谜题会出现各种问题，怎么也解决不了
and the problem with that is once that happens to you once, you no longer have any trust in the rest of the game
问题是，一旦你遇到这种情况，只需要一次，你就会对游戏剩下部分失去信任了
like every time you get stuck on a puzzle you might just think well what if the game's bugged again, right 
比如每当你卡在一个谜题的时候，就会想，会不会是游戏又出bug了，是吧？
uh it puts you in a state where you're no longer sort of following that drip feed of like oh i'm just on the cusp of something exciting I just need to push forward a little bit
这让你处于一种状态，你不再像以前那样觉得我在跟随着游戏的进程，处在激动人心时刻的边缘，只要再往前推进一下就好了
instead there's this sort of unhealthy skepticism that robs you of that motivating force to continue going in
取而代之的是一种不健康的怀疑态度，使你失去了继续前进的动力
this case for this Zelda puzzle it turns out you can get it at this stage of the game 
就这个塞尔达谜题而言，在游戏的这个阶段，你是可以拿得到的
you just have to go grab a chicken and you have to carry the chicken up quite a ways 
你只需要去抓一只鸡，然后带着这只鸡走一段路
but then you can sort of use it to sail over there because when you're holding the chicken you fall much less slowly 
然后你就可以拿着鸡飘过去，因为拿着鸡的时候，下落速度会慢很多
and so it in fact does have a solution but that may not be obvious to you until much later in the game
所以它实际上是有解决方案的，但你可能要到游戏的很后期才会发现
uh a way of dealing with this that Supraland used 
《Supraland》里面用了一种方法来解决这个问题
was to actually have NPCs that tell you have everything you need to solve this puzzle, go for it uh 
是让NPC告诉你，“你已经有解决这个谜题所需的一切东西，去解吧”
and this happens at multiple times in the game 
而这种方式在游戏中多次出现
in some cases you'll even reach an area where you can no longer go back 
在某些情况下，你甚至会到达一个你回不去的地方
like you have to fall off something and it locks you in a room 
比如你得从某个地方跳下去，然后把你锁在一个房间中
with an npc says you says you could solve this puzzle right now and then you just have to do it
有个NPC告诉你现在就可以解决这个难题，然后你就必须去做
and Supraland is a Metroidvania where you're constantly getting new items that add new abilities or affordances to the player 
《Supraland》是一个类银河恶魔城游戏，你会不断得到新物品，为玩家增加新能力
and so, you might often come to a puzzle that you can't solve and say well maybe I just have to come back once I get an item
所以，你可能经常碰到无法解决的谜题，然后说，也许我得拿到一个物品后再回来
and so, if that were the case for every puzzle in the game
因此，如果游戏中每个谜题都出现这种情况的话
then the for the puzzles that gate your progression you know the player might just turn around and go do something else
那对于那些推进游戏进程的谜题来说，玩家可能就转身去做别的事去了
and so, something like this is in fact necessary 
所以，像这样的东西其实是有必要的
to sort of tell the player no you need to push forward on this one puzzle
它可以告诉玩家，不，你需要在这个谜题上继续努力
even though it's hard you can do it um
尽管谜题难，但你可以做到
and Supraland was a very highly reviewed game it was 96 positive on steam 
《Supraland》是一款评价很高的游戏，在steam上有96%的好评
it was one of my favorite puzzle games of this whole year
它也是我那一整年最喜欢的解谜游戏之一
um but you know many people might think this is breaking the fourth wall
但很多人可能认为这是在打破第四面墙
it's a little bit distasteful there's some kind of dissonance going on here between the character and the player and what's happening and 
这有点让人反感，在角色和玩家之间产生了不协调
David Münnich is a very experienced puzzle creator 
David Münnich（《Supraland》的作者）是一位非常有经验的谜题创作者
he was the creator of the original Notpron which was the most famous internet riddle of sort of the flash internet era back in the early to mid-2000s 
他是《Notpron》最初的制作者，这是00年代前中期Flash游戏时代最出名的解谜游戏
and so, he's been creating puzzles for a long time and understands very well the experience that a solver goes through when they're solving a puzzle 
所以，他已经创作了很长时间的谜题，并且非常了解解谜者在解谜时的体验
and he felt it was necessary to do this because he wanted to preserve the sanctity of the player's trust that the puzzle itself is solvable
他觉得有必要这样做，因为他想保持玩家对谜题本身可解的信任的同时
while also making a Metroidvania where you're getting new items all the time that do new things
制作出一个类银河恶魔城游戏，在其中玩家会不断得到新物品、做新的事情
so, an interesting solution to the problem a related idea is that of “square dealing”
这个问题有个有趣的相关解决方案，那就是“公平交易”(Square Dealing)
which uh it's a term that I’ve seen in crossword communities and other puzzle communities 
这是我在填字游戏社区和其他解谜社区看到的一个术语
but it basically refers to the conventions that the constructors of puzzles are abiding by to play fair um 
它本质上是指的是谜题创作者为了让玩家顺利玩下去而遵守的惯例
and you'll see many of these conventions 
你会看到有很多这样的惯例
for example in puzzle hunts they will never have anagrams without a clue 
你如在解谜寻宝中，他们不会出没给线索的同字母异构词
and the reason is because when you're doing a puzzle hunt puzzle these are typically puzzles where the rules are not provided 
原因是当你在做解谜寻宝时，这些谜题通常没有提供规则
and you have to figure out what it is that you need to do 
你需要做的就是找出这些（规则）是什么
you might literally try anagraming everything 
你可能会试着把所有词的异构词都尝试一遍
you could dump every word in this puzzle the title of every puzzle whatever into anagram generators 
你可能会把谜题中的每个词、每个谜题的标题都放到异构词生成器中
and just come up with nothing or come up with something that's maybe tenuously there but turns out to be nothing 
然后什么都没有得到
and that experience as a solver is not a pleasant experience 
作为一个解题者，这种体验并不愉快
so, to you know save the solver from having to do that 
所以，为了让解谜者不去做这种事情
the uh the authors of puzzle hunt puzzles will just tell you right up front there are no unclued anagrams in this puzzle hunt 
解谜寻宝的作者会直接告诉你，这里面没有没提供线索的同字母异构词
and that will be part of the rules that are communicated to the player um 
而这也是传达给玩家的规则的一部分
Cryptic Crosswords have a similar convention where they don't do indirect anagrams 
Cryptic Crossword也有类似的惯例，它们不会有不直接的异构词
which is basically like uh you know if there's an anagram it has to be clued by a trigger word 
基本上就是说，如果里面有一个异构词，那么它就必须由一个触发词来提示
and it can't be mixed with another type of hint 
而且不能和其他类型的线索混在一起
escape rooms have some conventions like “one key one lock “
密室逃脱也有一些惯例，比如“一个钥匙对应一把锁”
if you get a four-digit code, you're never gonna have to put it in multiple different four-digit combination locks 
如果你得到了一个四位的密码，那你永远也不需要在多个密码锁上输入它
because again that would just be irritating 
因为那也会让人很不爽
are you do you want the player to have to retry everything over and over again no
你想让玩家一次又一次地重试之前所有的东西吗？
so, one key one lock is sort of a convention that saves the sanity of some players
所以，“一个钥匙对应一把锁”是一种惯例，可以拯救玩家的San值
now whether or not this is advertised or told to the players before they begin
至于是否在宣传的死后或者在玩之间就告诉玩家
it's you know it's kind of 50-50. it depends on which escape room you're doing
可能五五开吧，这取决于你玩的哪家密室逃脱
uh no outside knowledge is another common convention
不依赖外界只是也是另一个常见的惯例
but it's sort of like if you're a solver of Cryptics 
然而，如果你是一个比如说Cryptic Crossword的老手，
you probably realize this no indirect anagrams rule 
你可能会意识到没有不直接的异构词这个规则
even if it's just subconsciously because you just never see it right 
即便这只是潜意识的，因为你从来没有见过这种情况
you just realize that oh well they wouldn't print that I don't have to do that 
你只是意识到，他们不会出这种谜题，我不需要这么做
but beginners may not understand this and may never even really have learned it unless somebody taught them 
但新手可能不明白这一点，除非有人教他们否则他们没办法知道
so, beginners can spend a lot of time on cryptics just trying stuff that is never possibly necessary 
所以新手可能会花很多时间在谜题上去尝试一些根本没必要的事情
because they don't understand the conventions of the genre right 
因为他们不了解这类谜题的惯例
so square dealing is important 
所以Square Dealing很重要
But in video games especially it's also important to communicate those rules to the player
但在电子游戏中，向玩家传达这些规则也很重要
because every puzzle game you play will have different rules about how the puzzles are designed and what's allowed and what's not
因为每个解谜游戏关于怎么设计的、什么能做什么不能做的规则都是不同的
and sometimes it's not that explicit 
而且有时并不那么明确
some games actually tell the player 
而有些游戏实际上会直接告诉玩家
and this is a game called Ittle Dew which is sort of a Zelda-like
这是一个叫《Ittle Dew》的游戏，是一个类塞尔达的游戏
and after you exit the first dungeon it literally tells you there's no missable items or chests in dungeons at all
在你离开第一个地牢后，它会直接告诉你，已经没有可错过的物品或箱子了
and not every Zelda-like has these types of conventions 
而并非每个类塞尔达游戏都有这种惯例
and in classic Zelda’s usually the convention is there's no need to return to dungeons later 
而在经典塞尔达中，通常的惯例是之后就不用回到之前的地牢了
meaning that every item that you could get in a dungeon is one that you could get with sort of the key or progression items from that dungeon and earlier or and the prerequisites
意味着在地牢里得到的每件物品都是可以通过钥匙或者进展物品而得到的
although that's not true in every Zelda and it's not true in uh every dungeon of every Zelda
虽然不是每一部塞尔达都是如此，而不是每个地牢都是如此
so, um having that type of square dealing is useful 
所以，有这种类似“Square Dealing”的原则是有用的
and communicating it to the player can really help build that trusting relationship that allows the player to sort of press on when they're stuck on a puzzle
将其传达给玩家可以帮助建立信任关系，让玩家在被卡住的时候可以继续前进
the sort of contrapositive to that is avoid cheap tricks
而与之对应的则是“避免使用拙劣的把戏”
I’m going to pick on the Talos principle 
我要批评一下《塔罗斯法则》
when it released it had a puzzle where 
当它刚发布的时候，有这样一个谜题
well this isn't one of the main puzzles in the game, it's actually one of the bonus puzzles that you have to get stars for 
这不是游戏里的主线谜题，是要拿星星的支线谜题
but one of the stars and it's very early on in the game 
但其中有一颗星星很早就在游戏里出现了
it's in the first uh first major area of the fourth world of that
就在第四个世界的第一个主要区域里
uh there is a hidden reflector up in a tree that you have to aim a laser at
有一个隐藏在树上的反射器，你必须用激光瞄准它
and uh up until this point in the game all the reflectors are just items on the ground you can pick them up and move them 
而在游戏的这个阶段，所有反射器都是在地上的，你可拿起并移动它们
this one is stationary and it's in a tree 
而这一个是固定的，而且在树上
and in no other part of the game do you ever have to look up in the tree for anything
在游戏的其他部分，你都不需要在树上找东西
and there are so many other things that you can try to solve this puzzle that almost barely work
还有很多其他东西可以尝试来解决这个谜题，但都没用
I literally wasted I don't know more than an hour trying to get this thing and then to learn that the answer was well it was in a tree
我真的浪费了可能一个多小时来解这个，然后得知答案是它在一棵树上
uh that was kind of upsetting 
这让人很不爽
but also, it made me distrust the developer 
但同时，这也让我不再相信开发者了
because for every other puzzle in that game instead of pressing on when I was stuck, 
因为对那个游戏中其他谜题，当我卡住了我不会再不停尝试
I just had this thought well what if it's some more *** like that reflector in the tree 
取而代之的是这样的想法：“这个会不会又是像树上的反光镜那样的***呢？”
um it turns out that after the game launched they actually patched it 
不过游戏发售之后，他们把这个改了
and they changed that reflector in the tree to a reflector on a very prominent salient pillar that you could see from all directions
他们把史上的反射器改成了放在一个非常显眼的柱子上，从各个方向都看得到
uh that made it clear that there was a reflector up there 
这样一来就很清楚上面有一个反射器
and then it became a mystery of what's that reflector on the pillar for, turns out one of the secret bonus stars 
然后就成了一个谜题：那根柱子上的反射器是干什么的？原来是为了一颗星星
and this is sort of a much more honest way of designing this puzzle 
这种设计谜题的方式就更加诚实得多
and it prevents that player's mind from being poisoned by well am I going to have to look in a tree forever 
这样可以避免玩家的思维被“我需不需要接下来都在树上找东西”的想法所毒害
I’m going to uh quote my good friend weihuawho said
我想引用我的好朋友黄炜华的一句话
“a good puzzle has an ‘aha’ moment a bad puzzle has an ‘oh really’ moment” 
“一个好谜题有‘啊哈’(Aha)时刻，一个坏谜题有‘啊？真的吗？’(Oh really?)时刻”
um wei-hua has a four-time world puzzle champion and he's been published uh everywhere 
黄炜华是世界谜题锦标赛的四届冠军，到处都有他发表的作品	
he's done crosswords for new york times he's done world puzzle championship stuff
他为《纽约时报》做过填字游戏，为世界谜题锦标赛做过东西
he's a game designer as well and done physical puzzles uh
他也是一个游戏设计师，也做过实物解谜
this guy is one of the most experienced puzzle creators I know
他是我认识的最有经验的谜题创作者之一
and for him you know this oh really moment this discovery of like it was that all along is uh a very negative experience when you're expecting or hoping 
对他来说，这种“啊？真的吗？”时刻就是那种你一直期待或坚持之后却得到了一个消极的体验
instead for an exciting eureka um
而不是一个令人激动的尤里卡时刻
Bob Bates refers to that as poisoning of the well 
Bob Bates将此称为 "向井里投毒"
bob bates designed a lot of uh adventure games point-and-click games for Infocom and legend entertainment in the late 80s and 90s 
Bob Bates在80、90年代末为Infocom何Legend entertainment设计了大量冒险游戏和点击游戏
and bob actually gave a gdc talk where he sort of emphasized that a good understanding of puzzle design theory was necessary to 
实际上Bob在GDC的演讲中强调了对谜题设计理论的良好理解是必要的
avoid this pitfall of creating a state in players where there's sort of this unhealthy skepticism that the designers aren't playing fair
以避免落入这样的陷阱，让玩家产生认为设计者不公正的一种不健康的怀疑态度
uh and here you know here's just a general list of things to avoid
这里是一个你要避免的一个清单
um anything that requires you to do lots of searching without a clue
任何让玩家在没有提示的情况下去做大量搜索行为的东西
darkness is a big one if there are dark corners of your game and literally the player has to walk into every one of them 
黑暗会是个大问题，如果游戏有黑暗的角落而玩家得一一尝试走进去的话
or even walk into every one of them and jump in order to find that hidden nook where you might have hidden something 
或者甚至为了找到可能藏有东西的隐蔽角落而在每个黑暗角落都跳一下
that's that can be irritating 
这就会让人很不爽
wall pressing if the player has to touch every wall, shoot every wall, press the action box on every wall um 
“Wall Pressing”指如果玩家必须摸下每一面墙，射击每一面墙，对每面墙都按下操作键...
if there are invisible platforms the player can't see them and they just have to jump randomly to see where there might be an invisible platform
如果有玩家看不见的隐藏平台，玩家就只能随机地跳来找哪里有隐藏平台
those types of experiences can be very draining for players 
如果玩家想完成你的谜题的话，这种体验是非常耗费精力的
because uh instead of feeling like they're on the right track
因为玩家并不觉得自己走在正确的道路上
they're feeling like they're just sort of laboriously searching the entire possible game for the thing you might have hidden if they want to sort of complete the puzzles
而只是觉得在费力地在整个游戏中寻找你可能藏起来的东西
so, you never want to do this 
所以，你永远不会想这样做
and the other thing that can happen is like say you had a clue which illustrated oh well you're going to have to jump in the dark
还有一种情况是，比如说你给了个提示，告诉玩家得在黑暗中跳跃
maybe the player didn't see that clue and they just happened to wander that way and find it 
或许玩家并没有看到那个提示，只是碰巧走到这个找到了这个谜题
the problem is if the player comes out and realized well there was no clue I guess I have to check every dark zone anywhere um 
问题是，如果没有发现这个提示，那我想我又得去每个黑暗区域一个一个看了
that is sort of an equal well poisoning right 
这就跟之前说的“向井里投毒”没区别了
so, you not just have to make sure you put the clue 
所以，你不仅要确保你给了提示
you have to make sure that the player can't get there without the clue 
你还得确保玩家在不知道提示的情况下就无法到达那里
you have to make sure the clue is somehow sort of obvious 
你必须确保提示在某种程度上是明显的
or at least the you know maybe when the players coming back out they will then see the clue 
或者至少，当玩家往回走，他们能看到这个提示
you know a way to avoid that
你知道有方法是可以避免这种情况的
you don't want to have puzzles that suddenly increase tenuousness 
不要让谜题突然变得不确定起来
like force the player to do something they never had to do 
比如让玩家做一些他们之前从来不需要做的事情
force the player to look outside the game when they never had to look outside the game
比如突然让玩家在游戏外去寻找，而他们从未这么做过
uh you know some kind of new trick or method that is suddenly used or required 
突然要求玩家使用一种新的技巧或方法
especially if it's a one-off if you only have to use it once 
尤其是如果这种方法是一次性的、只需要用一次的话
well will the player now be paranoid that they have to use it again 
那么，玩家现在会不会就偏执地认为他们之后必须再次使用它呢？
will they try it on every other puzzle in the rest of the game
他们会不会在接下来的每个谜题中都尝试这个方法呢？
you want to make sure that you don't have that situation 
你要确保不会出现这种情况
inconsistency in general if the rules are changing
如果规则一直变化的话，一般会产生不一致
then players will never know whether they can expect their understanding of the game, their conceptual model for how the game systems work to be correct if they're questioning the conceptual model
如果玩家不断地质疑游戏的概念模型的话，玩家将永远无法确定他们能否理解这个游戏，无法确定他们理解的游戏系统的概念模型是否正确
then they're not in a good space to do problem solving right 
那么他们就没有处在解决问题的良好的状态，对吧？
you want players to feel that they rock solid understand the game's rules the game's logic and are then solving things
你想让玩家对游戏的规则逻辑有坚实的理解，然后再解决谜题
rather than questioning that 
而不是去质疑它
at least if you're making a game that's about logic or about understanding rules 
至少对于如果你制作的游戏是关于逻辑或关于理解规则的话
there are some games that are just not about that and that's okay
有些游戏不是关于这个的，那这也没什么
there are some games that are just about rule discovery
有一些游戏只是关于规则的发现



but that brings us to point number 15 which is “be careful with intransparencies”
这就让我们来到了第15课，即「当心不透明性」
and intransparencies of a puzzle is any aspect that is not explained to the solver 
一道谜题的不透明性是指任何没有向解谜者解释的任何方面
a hidden rule a hidden goal 
比如一个隐藏的规则，一个隐藏的目标
maybe a hidden affordance meaning a hidden thing that the player can do
也许是一个隐藏的能力，比如是玩家可以做的一个隐藏的事情
or a hidden interaction or hidden consequence of a certain interaction
或者是一个隐藏的互动或某一互动的隐藏后果
intransparencies can also come in the form of the inability to perceive or interpret the state of the puzzle 
不透明性也能够以无法感知或领会谜题状态的形式出现
essentially if you're familiar with the quote unquote “seven stages of action”, 
基本上来说，如果你熟悉“行动七阶段理论”的话
（译者注：出自唐纳德·诺曼《设计心理学》，七阶段即：目标、计划、制定、执行、感知、解释、比较）
which uh I think Donald Norman was the one who initially uh made that a popular idea
我想应该是唐纳德·诺曼（Donald Norman）最初让这一观点流行起来的
any one of those seven stages of action can have a failure 
这七个行动阶段中的任何一个都可能出现失败
where due to intransparencies the person trying to perform an action just doesn't understand something right? 
由于不透明性，试图执行行动的人会对一些事情不理解
I will show you an example. This is a puzzle I have it right here 
我给你们看一个例子，这个谜题我这里有实物
It's called the Ramube Octahedron and this puzzle is a puzzle that you your goal is to try and disassemble it uh 
这个谜题被称为“Ramube八面体”，你的目标是拆开它
and sort of get into it and you can kind of like move one of the parts around but you know most of them don't really move 
仔细看看，你可以移动其中的一个组件，但大多数你是没法移动的
and if you listen carefully you can hear that there's something going on in the inside of it but you can't see what it is right 
而如果你仔细听，你可以听到里面有什么东西在动，但你看不到是什么东西，是吧？
so, this is an example of an intransparencies in a puzzle
所以，这就是一个谜题中的不透明性的例子
um another example would be instructionless puzzles
另一个例子是无指令谜题
um this puzzle on the left is uh from a round of the German national puzzle championship 
左边这个谜题是德国全国谜题锦标赛的一个赛题
which is how they select their team for world puzzle championships
他们通过全国锦标赛来选拔参加世界锦标赛的队伍
and they had an instructionless round 
他们有一个无指令的比赛轮次
and how it works is you're given an empty sort of input puzzle and then you're given its solution
操作方式是，你有一个空的输入谜题，然后你有它对应的答案
and your goal is to work out what is the rule where this input could lead to this solution 
你的目标是找出这个输入对应这个答案的规则是什么
and it's unique there is no other solution to this puzzle
而且规则是唯一的，没有其他规则能满足这个谜题
and sometimes that uniqueness is an important part of discovering what the rules are
而有时这种唯一性是发现规则的重要部分
and then of course they'll give you an actual contest puzzle that you have to solve 
然后当然他们会给你一个实际的比赛谜题，你必须（用发现的规则）解决它
and all of this including both discovering the instructions and solving the puzzle you're doing under time pressure 
全部这些包括发现规则和解决谜题都是在有时间压力下完成的
in this case the rule is that the number tells you of its four cardinal neighbors in the north south east west direction how many of them are different or how many different numbers are represented there
而这个谜题解出来的规则是，这个数字代表其上下左右相邻格子中有多少种不同的数字
so, a one uh you know this one has two threes next to it. it only has one unique neighbor 
因此，这里这个1，它旁边有两个3，所以只有一种
whereas this four has all four of one two three four as its neighbors
而这个4，它旁边有1,2,3,4作为它的邻居
another example is this game understand which is a steam game 	
另一个例子是这个steam游戏《顿悟》
（译者注：《顿悟》为中国开发者制作的游戏，作者B站账号@ ArtlessGames）
where they give you a bunch of symbols on the grid and you have to figure out the rules 
在这个游戏中网格上会有一堆符号，你必须自己弄清楚规则
the witness also has this instructionlessness as a part of sort of the early phase of the game when you're learning what the rules are rather than the later phase of the game where you're solving puzzles using those known rules
《见证者》在早期学习规则的阶段中也有这种无指令谜题，而在后期则用已知的规则来解谜
uh mystery hunt puzzles are basically all instructionless. they tend to give you some input and then find something to solve.
解谜寻宝比赛基本上都是无指令的，他们会给你些输入，然后想办法解出来
this is one from this year's mystery hunt where the input was a picture of a bunch of diagrams of what look like sound devices or digital synthesizers 
这是今年解谜寻宝的一道题，输入的内容看起像一堆声音设备或数字合成器的连线图
and you get a bunch of these and then you also get these like random strings of letters some of which are red colored
然后你有一堆这样的图，以及这些随机的字母串，其中一些是红色的
and it turns out that you have to download this software that sort of allows you to put together eurorack style modular synths and put them together this way 
最后结果是，你得下载一个软件能让你把Eurorack风格的模块化合成器摆成这样
and they would all make synth noises from popular songs uh you know like a synth from lady gaga or from Eurythmics or from whatever
然后它们会生成一些流行歌曲的合成声音，比如Lady Gaga、Eurythmics的合成音
and then these things on the right corresponded to the melodies that you had to play and then you had to put the melodies together and get a secret message from that 
然后右边这些字符串对应着一些旋律，你得把这些旋律放在一起播放，从中得到一个秘密信息
and then there was a whole second part to it
然后接着还有一个完整的第二步
um but the point is that the rules are not given at all
关键点是规则根本就没有给出
and figuring out the rules figuring out what you have to do and getting that aha moment of oh these are songs I have to play them 
弄清规则、弄清要做的是，然后会得到一个“啊哈”时刻，哦，这些是我得播放出来的歌曲
that is part of the magic of MIT mystery hunt, is discovering what it is that you have to do 
这就是MIT解谜寻宝的魅力所在，就是去发现你要做的事情是什么
and intransparencies can be a huge amount of fun but there are many caveats 
不透明性可以带来很多乐趣，但也有许多注意事项
they can cause solvers to become stuck and I’ve heard this called enigma syndrome or a few other things
他们会让解谜者卡住，而且我听说过一种叫“谜题综合征”或类似的东西
where you literally just don't know what to do because you failed to put two and two together
你真的不知道做什么，因为你没能把两部分对应起来
and that tends to be an unfun kind of stuck for many puzzles 
对于许多谜题来说，这往往是一种不愉快的卡壳
because you don't necessarily have different approaches or different things to try 
因为你不一定有其他不同的方法或东西可以去尝试
there isn't really a recourse for you if you just can't figure out what you need to do 
如果你连做什么都不知道的话，那也没什么办法能依靠了
if you're making a linear story based game where the puzzles have to come in sequence
而如果你在制作一个谜题按顺序出现的基于故事的线性游戏
then getting stuck means blocking progression in the game which literally means the player cannot play anymore
那么被卡住就意味着游戏进行不下去了，也就意味着玩家玩不下去了
unless they either look up the solution or cheat 
除非他们去找攻略或者作弊
or they just have to quit and come back tomorrow
否则他们就得退出游戏，明天再来了
and some players you know they really don't want to look up the solution right
而对于有些玩家，他们真的不想去看攻略，对吧？
but if they're gonna be uh you know very devout about that then they just can't play the game anymore right 
但如果他们（对不看攻略）非常虔诚，那他们就再也玩不了这个游戏了
they literally may just stop there and never play beyond that
他们可能就会在那里停下来，再也玩不了后面部分了
um you can see with the completion statistics of many puzzle games on steam
你可以从steam上很多解谜游戏的完成度统计中看到
especially if they have achievements you can see well 
尤其是那些有成就的游戏，你可以看到
oh everybody quit after this achievement because there was a really hard puzzle there that got stuck
噢，所有人在这个成就之后都玩不下去了，因为那里有个非常难的谜题而卡住了
on the other hand, if you're making a linear game and you want to avoid that 
而另一方面，如果你在制作一个线性游戏，而你想避免这种情况
you may end up taking every puzzle that is remotely difficult and kind of standing off the difficulty or adding hints 
你最后可能会把每一个难度过高的谜题都拿出来，降低难度或者加上提示
and those may make it a less pleasurable experience for some other players that really want the challenge right 
而这又会让其他一些真正想要挑战的玩家的体验下降了
so, you're having to balance all of these goals together if you make a linear game
因此，如果你制作一个线性游戏，你必须去平衡所有这些目标
another common complaint is that these intransparencies can feel like an IQ test 
另一种常见的抱怨是，这些不透明性会让人感觉在做智商测试
it feels like oh I just have to figure out what the pattern is 
这感觉就像，哦，我得弄清楚这模式是什么
and some players don't want that to be their puzzle solving experience
而有些玩家不希望他们的解谜体验是这样的
the resolution of the intransparency is also a one-time reveal 
同样，不透明性的解总是一次性的
you can't make a hundred puzzles that are based on one intransparency 
你不可能基于一点规则的不透明性，就做出上百个谜题
you have to have a hundred different intransparencies and so it could be hard to come up with that
你得有100个不同的不透明性，所以要想出这样的谜题可能会很难
they're also easily spoiled especially if somebody is playing on live streaming service 
不透明性也很容易被剧透，特别是在直播的时候
like twitch one person in the chat can just tell them the answer and then it's all over
比如在Twitch上，一个人在聊天框中直接把答案说了，那一切都结束了
so, intransparencies are often not that great 
所以，不透明性往往不是那么的好
and the reverse can also be bad 
而反过来的情况也不太好
if the streamer knows what's going on or knows the answer but the audience doesn't 
如果主播知道他在做什么或者知道答案，但观众不知道
then they'll just have to constantly explain the rules to them 
那么他就必须不断地向他们解释规则
which can make the streaming experience a bit worse
这可能会使直播体验变得糟糕
a very common example is the hidden affordance 
一个常见的例子是隐藏的能力
which is where you have some kind of affordance or thing you can do that is not tutorial to you or not told to you 
即你有某种能力或能做的事情，但教程没说或者没告诉你
and this is an example from the Wind Waker 
这是在《塞尔达传说：风之杖》的一个例子
you get this grappling hook and it sort of tells you how to use it and you can swing on things
你得到了这个钩爪，游戏告诉你如何使用，可以挂在东西上摇摆
um but there is another thing you can do with that and that is when you are swinging you can also stop swinging and climb the rope
但你还可以用它做另一件事，那就是当你摆动时，你也可以停止摆动并爬上绳子
and when I was playing this game, I never even knew you could do this
当我玩的时候，我甚至不知道可以这样做
and the method to do it is actually a little bit counter-intuitive 
而做到这一点的方法实际上是有点反直觉的
you have to hold the button that in the top right the ZR button here which basically stops you from swinging
你必须按着这个按钮，就是右上方这个，ZR键，它能让你停止摇摆
and then while holding that you have to press up to climb the rope 
然后在按住这个按钮的同时，你要按上键来爬上绳子
um and normally when you press up you press like up and down to swing back and forward and time your swings to move forward 
一般情况下，按上下键的操作是会让绳子前后摆动，然后找到时机荡过去
so, there's a second movement assigned to the same button
所以，这里是把另一个动作分配给了同一个按钮
uh and you have to climb up to the top of this rope 
你必须爬上绳子顶端
and now it's only required in a couple areas of the game to get a couple of secrets 
而现在只有在游戏的几个区域需要这样做来获得一些隐藏秘密
but you know I want 100% the dungeon I want to find all the secrets 
但我想要达成100%，想找到所有秘密
so uh it was really annoying to me that this was never explained 
所以，这真的有点恼火，因为游戏从来没有解释过这个这一点
and then I just had to figure it out uh and it's counterintuitive
然后我得自己找到解决方法，而这时不符合直觉的
and they also this was a port of the game uh an HD port of the game from the original GameCube to the Wii U
不过这是从原来的NGC移植到Wii U的高清重制版
and so, they had to change the controls. so, they may have not tested it enough
所以，他们不得不改变控制方式，因而可能没有进行足够的测试
they may have not done their focus testing to discover that this was a stuck point 
他们可能没有做重点测试来发现这是个会卡住的点
or they might have just left it in because it was only for a couple of puzzles anyway
或者他们可能直接把它留了下来，毕竟这只有几个谜题用到了而已
um but for some players this is very frustrating and it could really make you distrust the developers 
但是对于一些玩家来说，这非常令人沮丧，它可能让你就不相信开发者了
and normally you don't see stuff like this in Zelda because it's quite well tested
通常你不会在塞尔达中遇到这样的情况，因为塞尔达的测试做得很好
But in this one case it was really you know there are people online who raged about this quite a bit
但在这个案例中就…网上有很多人对这个问题非常生气



one of the ways you can avoid that is

tip number 16 which is to facilitate

experimentation um and i will show the

remove octahedron again as a way of

illustrating this basically like

it's clear that there's something

rattling around on the inside of it and

it's clear that if you kind of try to

push it this way

you can push it a little but it gets

stuck and

you can listen and you can discover that

okay there's some balls on the inside or

something moving around

and if you move it very slowly and

listen you can even try and hear what is

the shape of the cavity inside

this puzzle how many balls are there are

they in the same cavity or are they not

and you can learn all of these things

just by experimenting and slowly moving

the thing around in information

so the in transparency of what's in the

middle can be made transparent by your

own

interaction with the puzzle um you know

and and you will in fact discover in

this puzzle that there are two balls

inside

they are in the same chamber and that

chamber has the shape of an s

tetris piece and you have to get the

balls at the two opposite sides of it

because

the thing you're pushing down goes in

the middle so you kind of have to do a

spin move to get the two balls to the

opposite side to push it down which is

an interesting

eureka moment but one that you can

actually kind of deductively logic

yourself toward

if you experiment with it enough to

discover how it works

a rule of thumb that goes along with

this is avoid

making experimentation frustrating

i remember as a kid playing link to the

past and getting to this boss the

helmesor king

and this boss is really tough he comes

at the end of a long

gauntlet of difficult enemies that you

have to get through and if you die you

have to restart the whole dungeon and do

it all over again

and he is the first boss that you cannot

defeat using the sword alone

every other boss up until that point you

could just use the sword on them but

this guy you have to use the hammer on

him first and

you know it's the usual zelda trope use

the item from that dungeon to

defeat the boss of that dungeon but this

was the first time that that idea was

used in this game

and i remember being so frustrated that

i would get to this boss fight him my

sword would do nothing and i didn't know

what to do and i would just die

because this guy just hit so hard and

you know i would try that a few times

die get frustrated and then

not know what to do because i wasn't

able to easily experiment and figure out

what the boss's weak point was the

experimentation required all of this

effort beforehand

and i remember going to my cousin and

begging him to tell me how to beat this

boss

and he told me hit his mask with the

magic hammer

and i i still as an assault as an adult

remember those exact words that he used

because as a child this was so

pertinent and so salient to me when i'm

like fighting this boss and was

literally blocked by progressing in the

game

because i i didn't know that secret and

certainly that was a huge eureka moment

for me just being told the answer

because it was so important to being

able to progress in this game

but the thing that caused that

frustration was the fact that i couldn't

experiment or at least that

experimentation required so much effort

that i was never able to get there on my

own

another example uh and i love this by

the way is the hearthstone puzzle labs

which was an expansion to the

hearthstone

uh game made i think a year or two ago

um and there are a bunch of these

puzzles that you have to solve using

hearthstone cards and they're very

interesting very exciting i highly

highly recommend this even if you've

never played hearthstone

um but this particular puzzle uh

is a doozy it's called the test and

there is this

unit on the board called the test

subject and it has the property that

whenever it dies

it gives you a copy of every spell

you've ever played on it

and there is also a spell that you have

in this called vivid nightmare that

copies

a minion and when you copy a minion it

kind of also copies the triggers that

are attached to that minion so there's

this very sophisticated interaction of

creating copies of spells via minions

that you've copied

and there are also a bunch of spells

that you have that change the health of

minions and kill them and

and do various things um so the solution

to this puzzle you know you only have 10

cards in your hand but you actually may

end up playing 20 or 30 of them

to actually go through with it and for

each one of the cards you play you have

to sort of watch through its animation

sometimes there's voice lines uh and

the order of operations is very

important and even

learning what the priority of things are

like when a death happens in what order

do the triggers happen that order of

trigger interaction is relevant in this

puzzle

and the first time i solved this puzzle

or actually the first time i put

together a solution that i thought would

solve this puzzle

it turned out that it didn't work due to

some subtlety of the interactions that i

didn't know

and this was immensely frustrating but

was even more frustrating is that

that thing on the right over there is

not an undo button it is a reset button

there is no undo in this puzzle

and when you reset it clears the whole

board it plays an unskippable eight

second

animation there's a voice line that

comes from the the boss on the other

side who makes fun of you

and uh it's just the experience of

experimenting to learn what happens is

made very tedious by the interface

and you know hearthstone isn't a puzzle

game it is it is a game

uh that's very much about sort of the

charming whimsy of the interaction of

these cards in a magical universe and

those voice lines are part of what makes

hearthstone hearthstone

uh but in the context of a puzzle game

it it sort of became

very irritating for me to like actually

interface with the puzzle itself

um so it's something to keep in mind

that if you make experimentation

frustrating and if you make sort of

learning the underlying system of the

puzzle

difficult or frustrating or place

obstacles in front of the player of

doing that

then uh the player may never get to the

heart of the puzzle and may just give up

right they won't be uh you know driven

to continue playing by the exciting

thing around the corner they'll just be

like ugh

i can't be bothered one solution

to avoid making experimentation

necessary at all

is to show the player things that they

would otherwise have to find out don't

put a button on the ground

and make the player stand on it to see

what it does put a line next to the

button and a little indicator on the

wall

that can show the player what the puzzle

is going to do when they step on it this

is something that portal did

you know a decade and a half ago

it'll do does something even more

interesting where when you whenever you

hit a locked door or a locked gate

it will show these little particles that

travel from the locked gate to either

the buttons on the floor or the switches

that you have to hit

in order to activate it uh and this

removes the need for you to

figure out what combination of switches

you need to hit to open this door

and games like draw at deadly rooms of

death also do the same thing

so a related idea is always try to get

the solver on the right path

realizing that you're on the right track

is one of the most dopaminergic things

just in the same way that anticipating

you know a eureka moment being right

around the corner

is is really interesting sort of being

on the right track and being told that

you're on the right track

is is similarly very motivating uh in

american crosswords every letter is

checked meaning that every letter exists

in both the horizontal and vertical word

and when you get that confirmation and

ah yes this is the same letter when i've

solved both of these clues it gives you

this sort of satisfaction that you're

moving forward that you're making

correct progress

many crossword clues they may have

multiple possible answers right

there may be multiple possible words

that are four letters long and satisfy

this clue

but as we've sort of seen in some of the

earlier examples only one of them is

correct and you may not

know which one it is until you get this

confirmer

but the confirmer is sort of a push to

keep going and motivation

to understand that you're on the right

track

um cryptics actually do this within

individual clues

so uh in encrypted crosswords if you

don't know every clue actually contains

both a literal definition

and a sort of pun or cryptic

definition so you might see a seven

letter word for terrain scrambled coach

and you split it down the middle a coach

is a trainer

but the word terrain scrambled i.e

anagrams

is also the word trainer so within every

individual clue

you have a confirmer because you have

two sides of it

that make the answer and sometimes when

you're solving a cryptic you won't

necessarily solve both of them like you

might solve the literal clue and not

solve the other one and sort of check it

by the letter crossings

cryptics have fewer letter crossings

than american crosswords

um but sometimes the

answer kind of reveals what the pun was

and can create this exciting moment of

oh i get it it's terrain scrambled

um you know so it provides additional

sparkle

uh whoops okay we're back

uh let's see um puzzle hunts often also

have confirmers where sometimes

you know you're halfway through a puzzle

and you got somewhere and you you know

you think

maybe is this the answer and then you

type it into the answer box and instead

of saying good job you solve the puzzle

it says keep going and what keep going

means in that context is that that's not

the answer it's another clue

it's something that you can move forward

on in a different direction something

new you have to try

uh but that can also be very motivating

because it means everything you've done

up until now was something that was

intended for you to do

a related question that i often get is

are red herrings bad should you avoid

them

and i mean this is a very complicated

subject there are a lot of different

types of red herrings and whether or not

they're bad is very situational

a dressing is the name for sort of a

needless non-pertinent decoration that's

salient enough that the solver might

accidentally interpret it as pertinent

in chest puzzles for example if you just

add extra pieces that are not relevant

to the solution and don't prevent

any wrong solutions from being relevant

then

those are considered dressings and

they're often frowned upon because they

may distract the solver from what they

actually need to do

same thing in escape rooms like people

often want to decorate the escape room

and make it look nice

but uh you know players may see bars in

a jail and try and you know count them

and put that as a number in some

combination lock right like you gotta

really make sure

that uh your dressings are not

interpreted as

pertinent distractors are affordances

that you never need

um you know there's there's an example

like make 35 cents with 10 coins

and the quarter is not needed therefore

it is a distractor it's an affordance

that you didn't need but it sort of

feels like it should be there right it's

not

it's not a red herring that's going to

confuse you um

you know fake puzzles and ghost puzzles

are things that come up in

escape rooms where you see something

that looks like a puzzle but it turns

out not to be

a ghost puzzle is a puzzle that used to

be in the room and then was removed but

somehow there's some little bit of it

that's left that wasn't cleaned up

you might just see a shadow on the wall

of where something was or you might see

some parts of what used to be a puzzle

but they've been disconnected and are no

longer part of the solution

every escape room fan will tell you that

they've seen these

and they get so mad when that wasn't

taken out of the room because they'll

spend their time which in escape room is

precious you only have an hour to get

out

they'll spend their time trying to

figure out what to do with that thing

and if it turns out oh you didn't have

to do anything it wasn't part of the

puzzle

then that really irritates people it

feels like they've been robbed of their

time

obfuscation and misdirection come in

many forms and can be sometimes

interpreted as red herrings but

sometimes it's more like

uh showing the solver what is a

non-solution so that they can appreciate

the solution more

right there's various ways that

misdirection can actually be good

so you don't want to rule that out as

bad dead end approaches

are any approach that you might try to

solve a puzzle that immediately leads to

a negative confirmer meaning

meaning you try something and then you

learn oh this cannot be the approach

this cannot possibly work

there is a clear dead end to here the

opposite is a rabbit trail

which is an incorrect approach to

solving a puzzle that cannot be proven

not to work

um you know you might be in some block

pushing game and it turns out you have

to do this one thing but you're trying

this other thing

and it seems like you're maybe making

progress and you're trying a few more

things and you know it's just branching

and getting deeper and maybe you're

making progress maybe you're not

but an hour later you're still trying

that one thing and you haven't quite got

to the exit and maybe it's impossible

right but but you don't know you don't

have an obvious proof that's impossible

so you waste an hour trying something

that isn't the intended or correct

solution

rabbit trails are the most demotivating

especially for novices because novices

are not particularly good at guessing

what will work or guessing what the

intended solution method to a puzzle

will be

they may spend a long time and only

change their approach when they've

really just given up and been beaten

down into

thinking well you know i don't want to

try this anymore

to address this like really sealing off

rabbit trails is a good idea if you're

playtesting something and you notice

that players are spending a long time

trying an approach that doesn't work

you should probably either prevent them

from trying it or add a negative

confirmer of some kind you know

go back this isn't the solution not like

this

try something else and to discover those

you

really need to playtest it the the sort

of lesson

expressed in four words is match

pertinence with

salience pertinence meaning things that

are relative to the actual solution of

the puzzle things that are either

clueful

or are affordances that you need or are

interactions that you need to do

and salience meaning how much something

sticks out how

clear is it to the player that this is

important how important looking is

something

things that are important should stick

out things that

stick out should be important you do not

want to have negatives in either

direction you don't necessarily

well you don't want to have important

things that are subtle or at least are

more subtle than everything else in the

environment

and you don't want to have things that

stick out and look like they might be

clueful or might be puzzly that turn out

not to be

and keep in mind that video game players

especially

who are not necessarily experts at

puzzles they may not have the

conventions in

place that allow them to determine what

is clueful

like when you're solving an escape room

and you've done 50 of them

you probably can guess whether or not

something is clueful

if you're doing a mystery hunt puzzle

and you've done hundreds of them and you

see something you can probably guess

whether or not that's supposed to be a

clue or whether it's supposed to be just

you know flavor text flavor art not

relevant

but newer players are not able to make

that distinction

uh especially in video games because

video games have

conventions that change so much from

genre to genre

that it's it's very hard to play for

players to know what they know or know

what they're expected to know or know

what the game designer is expecting them

to

interpret so always try to match

pertinence with salience as much as you

can

next lesson is to seek depth in systems

and rule sets

this is a lesson that comes from

physical puzzle games

uh particularly those published by um

publishers like think fun and smart

games they have this interesting method

of putting together

physical puzzles rather than getting

just you know one puzzle like one of

these that you buy

they have a kit that comes with

different items that you can put

together

and then they'll have a booklet or a set

of cards that contain challenges and

each puzzle will come with say 50 to 100

different challenges of increasing

difficulty

almost in the same kind of progression

that you would see in a traditional

video

game um and so rush hour you're sort of

moving these cars around you have to get

the red car

out of the grid and there's just 50

different configurations of obstacles

for it

um each of which you have to solve and

so

it's a nice experience for somebody

buying these because they're sort of

more content it's not just one puzzle

it also can make manufacturing much

cheaper because you sort of have to

just make the set of parts once and then

make the 50 puzzles

uh the cards are really cheap to make 50

of and you don't have to make 50 copies

of the game board

it also allows the player to have a

conceptual model meaning develop a

sophisticated understanding

of what the pieces are how the work how

they move how they work how they move

around

once you have a eureka moment or a

discovery of an emergent consequence of

that system

you can reuse that knowledge in future

puzzles and puzzles can therefore

build upon one another with increasingly

complicated

sort of lemmas and templates and

theorems that the player can learn as

they're solving this puzzle

and as they develop a more and more

detailed model of what are the

consequences of this system so you get

depth and you also get consistency in

the design

and the emergent surprises can be much

much deeper than just some sort of

one-off on the surface trick

you know something something like the

remove octahedra and that's sort of one

trick that you can use one time

but in systems-based puzzles you can

have many different tricks that arise

from the same situation

this can make the eureka moment sort of

more exciting because they're more

surprising

because there's more depth behind them

they can also reduce the cost of content

creation

because you know you only have to make

one of these cards and designing a new

instance of a puzzle is

often a lot less difficult than

designing a new rule set or a new

gimmick for a new puzzle completely

i'll give you another example which is

from thomas snyder he's a three-time

world sudoku champion world puzzle

champion

he's the founder of grand master puzzles

which is a company that publishes a

puzzle blog as well as many puzzle

books and puzzle magazines he's also a

mentor to many people on topics relating

to puzzle design he's an advisor on my

latest

project uh he has this idea

which he's described to me as sort of

the capacity of a puzzle or the the

um the sort of space available to

in within a certain puzzle type to

express ideas of that puzzle

and the way he describes it is in two

different ways which are equivalent

how many can you create of this puzzle

type before you start repeating the same

tricks over and over again like say

you're doing sudoku

how many sudoku's can you make before

the solution to the

sudoku's is just going to have no new

ideas and the answer is it's probably

somewhere between 50 and 100 it might be

like 80 sudokus

he also describes it as how many of this

puzzle type he would actually want to do

in his life like say somebody made the

perfect puzzle book

of sudoku puzzles let's say and you know

tried to include

all of the interesting sudoku tricks in

there but not really repeat them much

you know how many puzzles would that

book have in it it's not a thousand

sudoku puzzles it's much less

and different puzzle types have

different capacities

you know a simple two-dimensional maze

you know you can do one of them and then

you sort of learn well okay follow the

right-hand side or whatever

there's not that much to do something

like a portal gun may only really

support

10 different unique eureka moments

sudoku might be more like a hundred

and a game like the witness could be 10

times that just because it has so many

different

uh components that can go into those

puzzle systems different rules different

uh

symbols and constraints within each

puzzle

go problems might be the deepest of them

all i i think there are people who've

solved ten thousand go puzzles or more

and are still finding unique and

interesting ideas

in new puzzles that they haven't seen

before and that's something

a bit unique and remarkable about the

game of go whose rules are very simple

but

somehow there's this unexpected depth

there where you can express

tens of thousands of different ideas

using the sort of basic

uh go rules um

you know you might think are there

really only 10 portal gun puzzles like

portal had more levels than that right

like aren't there more ideas than that

well

i mean i'm talking about just the basic

sort of portal gun and walls there's not

that many things you can do with it like

there's traversal there's some line of

sight shooting tricks you can put a

portal on the ceiling there's the

momentum conservation trick

there's a lot of tricks where you sort

of move one portal but leave another in

order to be able to get back to a place

where you were before

but very quickly you start running out

of ideas to make truly unique

puzzles and then you start to add you

know you need to add new components the

the death pits and the missile turrets

and the companion cubes and the buttons

you can push them on

and then in portal 2 they add the light

bridges and the anti-gravity spirals and

the

the the paint that you can paint on the

walls to make them portable and the

bouncy colored goop that you can speed

off of and bounce on

you know these new components are what's

adding additional capacity to the

puzzles to be able to express

more unique eureka moments but just the

raw ingredients

uh are not really that uh

they can't speak to that many eureka

moments there's just not that much there

and what logic puzzle folks do is they

often create hybrids and variants

these are all sort of variations on

sudoku you can see here there's one

where the regions are not square there's

a hex grid

there's a ish grid or sort of on the

surface of this isometric cube

um and then increasingly complex

variations uh or hybrids as they are

often called where you're blending one

type of puzzle like sudoku with another

type like a domino puzzle

and through hybrids and variations you

can sort of have limitless variety and

endless eureka moments

uh because each of these puzzles sort of

has has its own rules and its own

consequences

and its own emergent complexity or

lemmas that arise from that set of rules

there are some sort of common tropes in

these changing geometry or topology

moving from

you know flat geometry to a cylinder or

a torus moving from a square grid to

triangle or hex or

whatever other grid type you want adding

new constraints and clue types

combining two puzzle types together liar

clues you know exactly one of these

clues is wrong there's a wolf in sheep's

clothing somewhere

cipher clues where you replace numbers

in a grid with a set of letters and each

letter

corresponds to a unique number off by

one or or cannot deny bin as it's often

called

uh where every number in the grid is off

by one you know a three could be either

a two or a four you know these are

common ideas you'll see over and over

again in logic puzzles

and they add a lot of depth and

complexity

sort of new eureka moments um

there's this question like where does

depth come from

in certain types of puzzle systems

somehow go is inherently deep

and it's very difficult to understand

why it is so

deep there is this computational

complexity answer which is like oh you

know a go

go is np-complete or piece-based

complete if you're familiar with

complexity theory

and that sort of represents that go can

sort of encode

other types of puzzles which are

increasingly complex and that may be

true but often

uh the way you represent something very

complex is like

you know building a circuit out of ghost

stones and then like this circuit is

only satisfiable if

you know player white wins in this go

situation

and those can be very contrived what's

unique about go

is that it's complex even with

relatively simple constructions of you

know a little puzzle that takes up one

quarter of a go board or less

um without necessarily a lot of

contrivance right

games like hearthstone have huge amount

of contrivance to their puzzles because

there's thousands of cards in the game

you'll never run out of puzzles to

create because there's just so many

cards there

and some games like the witness or baba

is you they get away with the

interaction between the different rules

and constraints

giving you this emergent complexity you

know you may have uh

n different rules but there are sort of

two to the n different ways that those

can be combined together and so you sort

of

you know there are n squared ways for

example that you can take a pair of

rules and combine them but sometimes

even three or more

will give you unique emergent eurekas

that don't exist with two or less

of the rules combined especially in a

game like baba is you

where sometimes you need five rules put

together and then something magical can

happen

level geometry is another thing that can

give you

really interesting deep emergent

interactions a few examples of this

one is steven's sausage roll which is a

game where you're running around

as this little character with a fork

skewering sausages pushing them around

picking them up and later you know

dragging them up ladders and doing

interesting contortions with with your

body and various other things

which uh um you know i almost don't want

to spoil them because they're magical i

know i've been spoiling a lot of stuff

in this talk

when you're talking about puzzle design

you invariably have to spoil things

um but this is a game that is worth

playing

uh to the end or you know at least

learning all of the things that it does

uh because it's so remarkable like like

there's no

new items you pick up when you're

playing steven saucer

you don't open a chest and get the hook

shot or the power glove you know it's

all

just the base movement of the game two

other games that are similar are pipe

push paradise and a monsters expedition

where you really just have

a sort of a simple move and push type of

mechanic

but a lot of emergent complexity via the

interactions that happen with the

objects you know in pipe push paradise

you can sort of push

pipes down into holes and roll them over

while a piece of them

goes into a hole and then comes back out

uh in a monster's exposition you're

rolling a log

over another log and then pushing them

into the water and then

while in the water there's different

things you can do with them it's uh

quite an interesting experience and both

of these games are massive rabbit holes

to go down a monster's expedition has

i like 500 600 i don't know how many

levels it has a lot of levels

hundreds of them um containing dozens

and dozens of unique ideas

that are all consequences of basically

just moving cylinders around

and if you have a sufficiently complex

system

then just through changing the shape of

levels you can allow the player to

experience

all of these different things you can do

without adding too much in the way

of new mechanics or new things i mean

all of these games do have new mechanics

and new things right steven's sausage

roll at some point adds in ladders

pipe push paradise at some point adds in

the ability to rotate a pipe

monster's expedition at some point adds

in uh rocks of different heights

uh but it doesn't add too much of them

there's a very low amount of new things

whereas some puzzle games every five

puzzles they give you you know a new toy

to play with or a new

uh ability to use these games are very

minimal on that and instead try to

explore the space of available ideas or

or consequences of those ideas

as much as possible most of the sort of

common puzzle tropes that you see

over and over again in puzzle games are

there because they combine two things

one is they're actually hard they

they're sort of np-hard or p-space hard

or have some kind of actual complexity

theoretic

hardness to them meaning they can encode

many hard problems

but they also they aren't too chaotic

and random they're things that

humans can reason about and facilitate

uh deeper understanding of you know

connectivity and paths human brains are

just great at seeing when things are

touching when they're adjacent

you know when this blob is one thing

instead of two things

packing or covering like shapes mental

rotation to fit things together

perspective or line of sight sort of 3d

geometry of when something can be seen

from something else

these are all things that human brains

are just naturally good at reasoning

about

logic gates and state manipulation these

are just you know

good examples of ways to get complexity

in puzzle games but also allow the

puzzles to be things that have exciting

eureka moments that humans can discover

um next lesson is to understand your

puzzles

state space and this lesson comes to us

via a puzzle designer this is um his

name is oscar von devunter

and uh he makes a lot of different types

of physical puzzles

twisty puzzles uh he prototypes

themselves with a 3d printer he's got a

youtube channel which is

quite interesting to check out he's very

prolific

this is a puzzle that he worked on which

is published by a company called

hanayama puzzles

it's the cast h and they're these two

h-shaped pieces which can kind of

be stuck together and roll around one

another in these interesting 3d way

ways the goal is to separate the two

pieces but to do this requires a huge

number of moves

and oscar actually published the state

diagram of this puzzle these are sort of

all the different configurations that

these two pieces can be

in and the lines represent possible

transitions from those states

so wherever there is a line it means you

can get the two puzzle

pieces from that one state to the other

one and when there isn't a line it means

that somehow that transition has been

blocked either by a little nubby of the

puzzle a little piece of metal that kind

of just prevents you

from uh making that transition and

therefore

finding a solution to this puzzle is

equivalent to finding a path

through this graph from in to out along

these edges and creating this puzzle was

basically

a task of like snipping certain edges

until

the graph that remained was an

interesting maze to navigate that

didn't have too many dead ends but also

had some trails for you to wander down

which may or may not

lead you to the correct thing uh

i'll show you another example from

sokoban this is a paper by peter

yaroshek and

radek pelanek and in this puzzle they

take a bunch of instances of sokoban

and they diagram their state space using

a sort of node and edge graph

representation where each node

is an individual state of the puzzle and

each edge is sort of a connection

between those two states

and a state in this case con consists of

a location of where the boxes are

and a connected region where the player

is so individual moves are not

considered state changes unless they

push a box

um but as you can see with this puzzle

there's this really tight bottleneck

around down here and that's sort of

is what makes this puzzle difficult

there is one unique

sort of key move or trick that you have

to do in order to get to the goal

and the coloring here is based on

players trying to attempt to solve this

puzzle and how much time they spent in

each state of the puzzle

the size of the dot corresponds to how

long players spent and you could see

that they spend a lot of time

not getting through the bottleneck and

once they get through there's hardly any

time spent at all because they're

immediately able to get to the goal and

so understanding that state diagram

allows you to sort of control

aspects of your puzzle by manipulating

it the larger the state space is

obviously the more difficult the more

possible states but the bottlenecks are

what create difficulty and if you have

multiple bottlenecks

that can make things even more difficult

this

in particular this sokoban puzzle is one

that takes an average of 30 to 40

minutes for players to solve this is a

really nasty one uh and that bottleneck

is the reason could you imagine if this

puzzle had a second one

afterwards uh players could be here for

a long time um so a related idea

is to understand your puzzle's solution

path and when i say solution path i

don't necessarily mean

just the path through that state diagram

but also the sort of

the state of the player as they're

solving the puzzle and

what are all of the understandings or

eureka moments that the player will go

through how are they going to make

progress through your puzzle noah

falstein gave a talk

in 2013 at gdc where he talked about

these dependency diagrams that they used

uh for adventure games of the puzzles

and this is sort of like the

pre-requisite chain of all the different

things you had to do in order to get

through this

this isn't even a whole game this is

like the intro sequence to this game

and one of the the pieces of advice sort

of the main piece of advice

he gave was to make these diagrams bushy

meaning not a long linear prerequisite

chain

but sort of a lot of different things

that you could make process

on concurrently without them sort of

blocking each other as prerequisites

and the reason to do this was to allow

the player to sort of explore and be

able to make progress in multiple areas

of the game without restricting them too

much without having that one single

bottleneck which would force the player

to do this one thing and everywhere else

in the game is just kind of useless to

them

um cameron brown has this interesting

illustration

where he shows slitherlink puzzles and

the rules of this puzzle are essentially

you're given as input

a grid made of dots and some numbers in

there and you have to draw a single

closed loop

uh around this grid and the numbers

indicate

sort of the uh adjacency uh how many

edges of that loop are adjacent to the

number so for example this three right

here

has three walls next to it this one

right here has one this this two right

here has two

um and slitherlink exists in some video

games as well the witness has a version

of slytherlink there are some other

games that have

similar ideas um but here on the top

he's showing a computer-generated puzzle

that was sort of randomly constructed

and on the bottom there's a

human-constructed puzzle

and the way in which the solver goes

from the initial puzzle to the solution

is very different for these two puzzles

on the bottom one there's kind of two

places you can make progress and you

sort of linearly do the bottom half the

loop and the top half of the loop and

they meet together

whereas this top one you can start just

about anywhere on any corner of the grid

and then you kind of get about this much

before you then have to

uh solve some more here's a bigger

example of a human-constructed

slitherlink puzzle where there's sort of

like three different

places where you can make progress

linearly and then in the middle uh they

all come together and and make the final

solution to the puzzle

and so as a solver you can start in a

couple of these different corners and

make progress

but when you're going along each section

there's this sort of smooth

flow of oh i did this oh now i get this

oh now i get this oh now i get this

and it feels very um exciting as a

solver

to feel that you're on the right track

and for every bit of progress to then

unlock further progress it sort of makes

that progress feel even better because

in addition to solving part of the grid

you're also

allowing yourself to solve another part

of the grid

so it's it's very exciting the linear

solution path

can be much harder especially for a

large puzzle because you may not know

where to start if you have a big grid

and there's literally only one place

where you can make progress then that

can

take a lot of time to find um whereas if

you have a bushy solution path then the

solver is less likely to be stuck

and can sort of proceed from more areas

and feel like they're making progress

sooner

but yeah the linear solution pass can

lead to sort of these interesting

solution flows that can be more of a

work of art and can be more exciting um

let's see so uh yeah this this is an

idea that

um we use internally working on our new

game

which is how big is the puzzle grid

versus how difficult it is

uh you know if it has few steps and it's

trivially difficult then it's

you know it's whatever it's boring it's

a tutorial puzzle it's nothing

but the two types that are interesting

are if you have many steps of low

difficulty we call this a flow puzzle

versus you have few steps but high

difficulty maybe only one difficult step

and sort of the whole puzzle is about

figuring out that one difficult

interesting thing we call that a gem

puzzle

and of course if you have many steps in

high difficulty then it's just a slog

it's going to be

you know it's going to take a long time

it's something you really got to get

invested into

but the flowy puzzles and the gems are

usually the most

suitable for video games and for us

they've been the most interesting

um i'm going to take a break and then we

will come back for the final part
